            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>TO THE HIGH AND MIGHTY PRINCE <hi>CHARLES;</hi> PRINCE OF GREAT BRITAINE, DVKE of Cornewall, Earle of Chester, Sonne and Heire apparant to the most Excellent and Illustrious Monarch, IAMES, by Gods great mercy, King of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Scotland, France</hi> and <hi>Ireland.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>ESVS Christ, the supreme King of Kings, and of all Lords transcendent Lord and Soueraigne Ruler, crowne your Highnesse with all bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sings from the heauens aboue, and from the earth beneath; that after a long and glorious life in this world, you may for euer and euer put on the Stole of immortall felicity in the world to come.</p>
            <p>The honour and dignity of Potentates and
<pb facs="tcp:2645:3"/> great Gouernours (most gratious Prince) con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisteth neither in the largenesse of their Empire, the riches of their Treasure, the abundance of Reuenew, the multitude of Subiects, the pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of Armies, the strength of Cities, Castles, Palaces or Guards: but in this is euery Prince re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nowned, if they which delight in Thrones and Scepters, embrace wisedome, that heauenly and diuine wisedome, which was the light vnto the feete,<note place="margin">Psal. 119.</note> and the Lanthorne vnto the pathes of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uid;</hi> euen true Religion, the sincere seruice of God.</p>
            <p>The sweete and Evangelicall Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> therefore declareth, that to vphold Religion, and to defend the Gospell, is the principall end for which all Gouernours and Magistrates were ordained. <hi>Kings</hi> (saith he) <hi>shall bee thy nursing Fathers,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Esay 49.23.</note>
               <hi>and Queenes shall be thy nursing Mothers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And this indeed is the chiefest reason why vnto Kings, Princes, and great Rulers common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the trauailes and labours of the pen, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken in defence of Religion, are commended; not, that by their power men do expect to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended from slanderous and poysoned tongues (which Kings and Princes themselues cannot a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uoid) but that vnto them which sit at the Sterne of gouernement, the knowledge of controuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sies
<pb facs="tcp:2645:3"/> in Religion should bee brought, to the end, that false worship being extirped, true Religion may be vpheld, and the right feare of God esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blished vpon the earth.</p>
            <p>Hauing finished therefore this poore Orphan labour of mine, begunne not without the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and approbation of that thrice-noble Prince, <hi>Henry,</hi> your Hignesse late dearest and most worthy brother; I thought it my duty to present it vnto your Grace, both in respect of that excellent knowledge of heauenly things, to which, euen in this your tender age you haue at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: as also for that vnder his hopefull aspect, it first tooke life and began to grow.</p>
            <p>Surely, I cannot tell to whom rather the knowledge of this cause should appertaine, then to your most excellent Highnesse: whom God (I hope) hath ordained, after a long period of the glorious and happy raigne of your august and gratious father, to sway the Scepter of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish Kingdom, which therefore the hellish brood of Locusts, Iesuites, and Seminaries do so much labour to bring backe againe vnto the Romish seruitude; not, that either they care for our sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, or that they dislike the doctrine of our Church, but for that this fertile Iland hath yeel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded such large reuenew, and copious prouent
<pb facs="tcp:2645:4"/> vnto the vnsatiable vultures of that Court.</p>
            <p>And it is worthy obseruation, that as neither Religion, nor zeale of the truth hath set these brands on fire to the deuastation &amp; combustion of Christendome; so no lenity nor mercy pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaileth to appease their gall: for otherwise, how could they breake out into such treasons and slanders against the most sacred person of our Tres-noble King? then whom, the Sunne neuer saw a Prince more mercifull, nor more clement; in so much that I should presume to haue said, that his pittie and compassion had beene more then the safety of his State could well endure: sauing that my Lord the King is euen an Angell of God discerning both good and bad.<note place="margin">2.

To which, while the people gaue ouer-light credence, counselling not as they were wont at the mouth of the Lord; they made with them an vnaduised league, and sware a peace to be repented. With the like fraud, vnder false pretence, and borrowed ragges of antiquity and succession, doe the Romish Masters, at this day, insinuate themselues into the hearts and fauour of such who giue no eare vnto the Word and Oracles of God.

            <p>I haue therefore, according vnto the measure of grace giuen me, in these my labours, vnscarfed the Papall policie, and laid open the mysterie of <hi>Babylon,</hi> shewing you her filthy parts, the very dregs of her cup: that seeing there lyeth much Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders poyson vnder her tongue, which you perceiue not; much gaule, much bitternesse, which by the lying glosse of false hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrisie is hidden from your eyes, you may at the last finde

            </p>
            <p>Your Missals, the solemne formes of publique Seruice, I haue vndertaken to examine, prouing out of them the Limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> and such other Sophisters (by which they go about to maintain the grosseness of errours) to be meere mockeries not obserued in the Liturgies of the Romish Church. I haue also studied to shew vnto you the abhominable false<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, superstition, and Idolatry, in the Breuiaries, and Masse-bookes contained; that when you see how the open religious seruice of God, is prophaned and falsified, you may iudge what faith or sincerity they keep in their priuate writings; and say with that great Physition, <hi>Si aqua praesocat, quid insu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per sorbebimus;</hi> If we be strangled with the purest water what then shall we drink?</p>
            <p>One thing let me especially commend to your considerations. Whereas it is a common opinion that your Missals &amp; Legends, of late time set forth, are more reformed then the old and obsolete; It is farre otherwise: for there is no blasphemy so great, nor superstition so absurd, to be found in the one, which is not as palpably deprehended in the other. For as of Masse-bookes the Romane Breuiarie, set forth by the authority of the Councell of <hi>Trent,</hi> and ratified by <hi>Pius Quintus,</hi> is held the tersest and most reformed: So the Legend published by <hi>Aloysius Lypomanus,</hi> is accounted the flower of Legends: But to speake the truth, these aboue the rest, by many degrees, surmount in all spirituall wickednesse, in all falshood and blasphemy.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:2645:9"/>
            <p>I haue not onely therfore vsed the testimony of the later Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gends and Missals, but of the former also; for that in many things the Romane Breuiarie not onely taketh hands with the most barbarous Legends of <hi>Lombardy</hi> and <hi>England,</hi> but it seeemeth for the most part, either taken out of the Missals of <hi>Sarisbury</hi> and <hi>Hereford,</hi> or at the least to imitate them in their Rites and Ceremonies.</p>

            <p>The captiuitie of the terrestriall <hi>Ierusalem</hi> was corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, carnall, and worldly.

            <p>The captiuitie of the Mysticall <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the militant Church of Christ, is chiefely spirituall, while the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of <hi>Babylon</hi> raigne not onely in their Palaces, but in the Soules of men, deforming the religion, changing the worship, altering the lawes, prophaning the Coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, poisoning the faith, blinding the knowledge, terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the consciences, and lading them with traditions, ceremonies, and constitutions, heauier then any clay of Egypt, more burdenous then any iron, any fetters of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon.</hi> For this cause, the raigne of Antichrist, and his Lordship ouer the Church of Christ, the Spirit of God calleth great <hi>Babylon,</hi>

               <hi>Oecumenius</hi> doe subscribe. This the Disciples of the Romish Church say is to bee vnderstood onely of Ethnicke <hi>Rome</hi> vnder the gouernment of Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perours. But to this their euasion the spirit of God it selfe hath framed a sufficient reply in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> where the mysterie of the Woman sitting on the Beast is described. Wee finde that this Beast was twofould; the first, and the second; Heathen <hi>Rome</hi> the professed
<pb facs="tcp:2645:12"/> enemie: and the <hi>Pseudochristian Rome</hi> a secret aduersarie, who hath the hornes of the Lambe, and vnder the name of Christ, and of the Church, doth all mischiefe both to Christ and to the Church. And surely of this second Beast the Scripture witnesseth, that he shall preuaile, and deceiue them that dwell on the earth, working signes, and making all captiue to the first Beast, and to receiue his Marke. So that Heathenish <hi>Rome,</hi> which before was wounded, is now healed and magnified by the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Beast; which indeed is not diuers from the first in person, but in respect: not in substance, but in qualitie of time and gouernement.</p>
            <p>Now, as the children of <hi>Israel</hi> from the first <hi>Babylon</hi> were by the mercy of God after long affliction deliuered (God mollifying the hearts of Kings and Princes to set them free, and to permit them to reedifie the decayed walles of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>) and <hi>Babylon</hi> it selfe also brought to extreame ruine and destruction: so the spirituall <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon</hi> is comn into remembrance also before God, and the Lord hath turned the hearts of them who formerly gaue their Kingdome to the Beast; so that now they hate the Whore and make her desolate, and by the mercie of God in sundry Kingdomes and Nations religion is pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged from superstition, the Gospell truely preached, Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments sincerely administred, our soule is escaped, as a Bird out of the hand of the Fowler, and there is sprung vp light for the righteous, and ioifull gladnesse among such as are true-hearted.</p>
            <p>This notwithstanding, as among the Israelites there were euer many found that would rather turne back vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Egypt, and be content to dwell in the house of their captiuitie, then in the good land which flowed vvith
<pb facs="tcp:2645:12"/> Milke and Honey: So in the Church of Christ there are found also Owles that delight in darknes; to whom the light, the libertie, the grace of the Gospell is burden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>some: which had rather be fed with Egypts flesh-pots, with Leekes and Cucumbers, then all the Manna that comes from Heauen; and the captiuitie of <hi>Babylon</hi> is farre sweeter vnto them, then the freedome of <hi>Ierusalem.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To recall these from their myre and their vomite, to which they are running againe, much labour by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny learned men hath beene bestowed; and of late time, from the Confession of Schoolemen, Iesuites, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Popish writers in their Bookes and Commenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, testimonies haue beene taken, as it were out of their owne bowels, to conuince Popery. Some also haue gone about to mitigate the opinions on both sides, and to draw them as neare together as they could. But alas, who can make peace betwixt light and darke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, day and night, truth and falshood, God and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial, Christ and Antichrist? Such contraries brooke no pacification.</p>
            <p>Seeing therefore for these late yeares, in this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, and especially in my countrey of <hi>Worcester-shire</hi> diuers dayly fall from the truth, bewitched with the Cup of the glorious Strumpet, who sitteth vpon the Beast, and who are daily led captiue into <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the Emissaries of that chaire of pestilence (Seminaries and Iesuits euery where lurking amongst vs) I thought it my duety also amongst the rest, to stand in the gappe for the house of <hi>Israel,</hi> and to cast my poore myte into the treasurie, if so be by my simple labours any weake might bee strengthened, and any doubtfull resolued.</p>
            <p>Now because the abominable desolation is a subtill
<pb facs="tcp:2645:13"/> Mysterie, and the Purple Strumpet hath much more gaule and venime in her Cup, then shee openly sheweth to the world (to speake plainely) for that they ouercast their false doctrine, with faire glosses, to the intent they may conceale the dregges thereof from the eyes of men, and by all meanes couer and hide the depth of their im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pietie, lest the common sort should espy the same, and euery dogge barke at it; I haue endeauoured in this Treatise to strip the Harlot out of the raggs of her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse, and to shew her naked vnto the world; that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding her filthinesse, and her botches, the godly rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der may hasten out of <hi>Babylon,</hi> seeing it is become the habitation of Diuels, the hold of all fowle spirits, a Cage of euery vncleane and hatefull bird, that all her Restrictions, Limitations, distinctions, cautions, are but the guilt of her Hypocrisie cast ouer to deceiue.</p>
            <p>But so great is the lubricitie and subtiltie of this Mother of Whoredome and of Witchcraft, that it seemes as easie to fit a garment vnto the Moone, onely immutable in her mutabilitie: or (as the prouerbe is) to hold an Eeele by the tayle, as to force them to stand vnto any kinde of testimonie in matter of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. For if you vrge them with Fathers, they receiue the Fathers so farre as they agree with the Romish Church: If you alledge Councels, they except against them, as not assembled by the Romish authoritie: if with Schoolemen you presse them, what is more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon then, <hi>Hic Magister non tenetur?</hi> Yea, if they bee charged with the authoritie of the Pope himselfe, they say, he taught not Papally out of the Chaire, but spake after his priuate opinion. I haue therefore (not omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their priuate writings) produced the most part of
<pb facs="tcp:2645:13"/> my proofes out of the Missalls and Breuiaries, the formes of their publique worship. Which, though she haue an Harlots forehead, yet any reasonable man will thinke, the Babylonish Strumpet cannot for shame deny.</p>
            <p>The priuate authors alledged are old and new, obse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lete and flourishing; which I of purpose haue done, that I might shew, that their new writers, and of best esteeme, are nothing lesse superstitious, and lesse erronious then the <hi>Vetus Comoedia,</hi> the barbarous age of doting Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerie.</p>
            <p>To their new and reformed Missalls and Legends I haue also adioined the more ancient, euen for the same purpose. For in them all it will appeare, that, as the <hi>Cnidian</hi> Mason making a watch-tower in <hi>Egypt</hi> for the conduction of trauellers by the Sea in the night, being commanded to set the name of the King, at vvhose charge it was built, in the wall, did so indeed, but hee set it vp deceitfully, in plaister and parget onely; vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneath the which curiously in free-stone hee graued his owne name,<note place="margin">Sostratus Dexipha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis Cuidius Dijs salutaribu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Sostratus Dexiphanis</hi> the <hi>Cnidian</hi> to the sauing Gods; that when the Morter was fallen off and decayed, all the praise might redound vnto himselfe, as though he had beene the founder of that worthy worke: So the Romanists deceitfully and colourably call their Masse the seruice of God, and pretend his worship in the superficiall appearance thereof; but in deed and in veritie all the honour is giuen to men, vnto Saints, vnto Images, and senselesse blockes; and this is the onely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of their Legends and Missalls.</p>
            <p>It may perhaps be thought in me, an ignorant man, and of very meane gifts, an audacious and presumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb facs="tcp:2645:14"/> part, to deale in a matter of this high nature, and weightie argument. But to this I reply, that I haue read of Cities throwne downe in Spaine by Connies, in Thessalia by Moles, in France by Frogges, in Africa by Locusts; and there is no instrument so exile and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, by which that great power cannot worke, who calleth light out of darknes, and in the mouth of Babes and sucklings hath ordained praise.</p>
            <p>Hereto I must also adde, that these my weake la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours were in a manner extorted and wrested from mee by diuers of them, who in these parts are blinded with Popish errour and superstition. For while I bended my selfe chiefely to this purpose in my ministerie, to beat downe the walles of the spirituall <hi>Iericho,</hi> which I saw goe vp so fast, and to bee fauoured by many of great authoritie with vs, they there vpon tooke occasion to slander my doctrine, and to report of mee, that I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied Iesus Christ to be crucified, and that I preached, how men ought not to come vnto God through Iesus Christ; and sundry other slanders both towards my la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, and my selfe. Wherefore I thought it meet, by this my trauaile, to make profession of my faith pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liquely, and also to lay open vnto them that shall vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>safe to peruse these ensuing obseruations, the blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie and Antichristian opposition, wherewith the Man of <hi>Rome</hi> impugneth Iesus Christ, the glorious Sonne of the liuing God.</p>
            <p>To conclude, if by these my simple trauels GOD may bee glorified, the truth defended, fals-hood dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couered, Hypocrisie vnmasked, the ignorant informed, the wauering and doubtfull confirmed, <hi>Litatum est,</hi> I haue my desire; if not, I haue done my indeauour, and
<pb facs="tcp:2645:14"/> discharged my owne soule, referring the successe vnto him, who is onely able to giue strength and power to the weake things of the world to ouerthrowe the migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to perfect his owne power, in our weakenesse: To whom, the Father of all that is called Father both in Heauen and in earth, the blessed and eternall Sonne, with the sweet and sanctifying Spirit, three persons and one glorious God, be all power, might, Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iestie and dominion, vpon the knees of all hearts ascribed for euer and euer, <hi>Amen, Amen.</hi>

But leauing all these, which through the slender creuisse of Naturall wisedome, or the Legall veyle of Iudaicall dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, did rather prye at the light, then behold it; Let vs search what Titles of honour, what Appellations, what so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueraigne names full of mysterie &amp; excellence, the Spirit of God in the Scriptures of truth, haue giuen to our Redeemer.</p>
                     <p>Of the names of God there are sundry. Some are Appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, which substantially expresse what he is; as when he is called God: some by relation expresse the persons; as when we say, God the Father, God the Sonne, and God the Holy Ghost: some by way of Similitude expresse him; as when Christ is called<note n="o" place="margin">Col. 1.15. Heb. 1.3. Ioh. 14.17. &amp; 1. Ioh. 2.27.</note> the image, the brightnesse: and the holy Ghost is called the Spirit, the Vnction.</p>
                     <p>Some names are the names of the Essence, some of the persō, and office. Whatsoeuer Appellations declare the substance of the Godhead, are common to the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Ghost: but the names which expresse the proprietie of the person, are not communicable to any, but the person of whom they are spoken.</p>
                     <p>Some things are spoken specially of the God-head of Christ, which yet by communication of properties, are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the Manhood: as the onely begotten Sonne,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.18.</note> which is in the bosome of the Father: some things are spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of the Manhood, which yet are by communication of the properties, applied to the God-head; as when it is said,<note n="h" place="margin">Act. 20.28.</note>

                     <p>Wherefore as euery man declareth himselfe to another by his word: so God manifesteth himselfe to the world by his Sonne, who interpreteth the will of God to vs, and is the substance, very God of God his Father.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. IX.</hi> Of the sundry considerations of sinne.</head>
                     <p>TWo things there are in sinne: the corruption of sinne, and the punishment of sinne. The corruption of sinne is seene in that continuall peruerse will and desire of ours, by vvhich wee striue to doe the things, that are displeasing to God, and to transgresse his lawes, &amp; breake them daily. This corruption and deformitie doth ouergoe the body and soule of Man; so that hee, vvho in the beginning vvas created to the image and likenesse of God, hauing the innocence, the holinesse, the wisedome, and the eternitie of God shining in him, is now become like the Diuell, blacke, spotted, vncleane, leprous, foolish, mortall. For though the act of sinne when it is begunne, is also quickly ended: yet the corruption of sinne in vs, is euer in the sight of God, and for it to him wee are still abominable. Abominable was sinne in <hi>Adam,</hi> abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable it is in vs: in him as the spring, in vs as the streame. Let vs speake of the deformitie of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne first, and then of our owne.</p>
                     <p>The vilenesse of <hi>Adams</hi> sinne in himselfe, three manner of wayes is declared. First the obiect, against whom it vvas committed. Secondly the person, vvho did commit it. Thirdly, the whole nature of Man, which he did deordinate
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:2645:43"/> and infect, doth shew the greatnesse of his fault. In that he sinned against God, infinite was the sinne; for hee sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the infinite power which had made him; the infinite wisedome which made him to his owne likenesse, the purest metall to beare the image of the King himselfe. He sinned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the power, the wisedome, the loue, the Father, the Sonne, the Holy Ghost. Wherefore from the whole Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie came that <hi>Sarcasm</hi> of indignation;<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 3.22.</note>
                        <hi>The Man is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come as one of vs:</hi> Thus Man, vvho in all things else was finite and had limits, in sinne is infinite, and beyond all limits. Secondly, the person who did commit the sinne, doth ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grauate the same: the power, the wisedome, the loue incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible created him in the body from the earth, in the Soule from the heauen, that heauen and earth conioyned, he might be another world in himselfe. Wherefore he deckt his earth vvith the fayrest feature aboue all other creatures; so farre, that there was nothing vvhereof he might be ashamed: and adorned his Heauen (the Soule I meane) vvith light more excellent, then of the Sun, or of the Moone; <hi>Ʋnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing, memory, Will;</hi> a Trinitie after his owne example, full of perfection, goodnesse and excellence. But Man, wretched Man, wilfully cast away his Trinitie of grace, giuen by the Trinitie of the supreme Essence, and gaue it vp to the Trini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie of vile and base suggestion, delectation, consent; by which all the power, the wisedome, the loue, which from the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power, vvisedome, loue, he had receiued, vvas turned into weaknesse, foolishnesse, vncleannesse; weaknesse of memory, foolishnesse of vnderstanding, vncleannesse and vvickednesse of will: and this he did, no necessitie compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling him, beleeuing the Diuell, louing his wife, preferring his desire aboue God the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost. His sinne vvas spirituall, hearkening to an Apostata spirit: his sinne was corporall, pleasing himselfe in the taste of an Apple. The commandement easie to be obeyed: his vvill, iudgement, knowledge, loue, all perfect, and therefore hee might haue stood: his temptation onely outward, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hee needed not to fall. All things neglected, for a trifle
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:2645:44"/> he prouoked the highest God, vvittingly, vvillingly, mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciously, rebelliously; therefore his sinne vvas infinite, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakeable, vvithout defence vvorthy of the deepest dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Adam</hi> in his sinne did deordinate, or turne from the due end, himselfe and all his progeny that came from him: a murtherer before a parent, vvhose offence imposed a double necessitie vpon vs; necessitie of death, the corruption and the destruction of our nature. A little drop of Wine poured into vvater doth diffuse it selfe through the whole vessell. Euery little graine is infinitely diuisible (as Philoso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers imagine) and so vvas <hi>Adams</hi> sinne transfused from him into all his posteritie: so that from the sowre and filthy fountaine proceed not but sowre and filthy vvaters. The end for vvhich Man was created,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.9. Esay 35.10. Esay 43.7.</note> vvas infinite good, which eye hath not seene, eare hath not heard, nor euer entred in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the thought of Man. From this hath <hi>Adam</hi> turned all his posteritie. O infinite transgression! all eyes may deplore it, all eares glowe to heare it, and euery heart rent in pieces to thinke on it: which is to beare intolerable; to auoid, vnpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible; to answere, vnexcusable.</p>
                     <p>As our originall sinne is an vniuersall botch, a generall le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prosie ouer all mankinde: so of our own actuall sinnes none can describe the filthinesse; more innumerable then the haires of the head, more importable then the sands of the Sea. <hi>Adams</hi> act corrupted his nature, our nature corrupts our acts:<note place="margin">Psal. 14.3.</note>
                        <hi>There is none that doth good, no not one.</hi> And as the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, gold hath his drosse if it be fined: so the holiest action of ours is sinne if it be examined. Wherefore all is conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded vnder damnation. For he that committeth sinne is of the Diuell,<note place="margin">1. Iohn 3.8.</note> farre from God: farre from light: farre from life: farre from hope;<note n="b" place="margin">Esay 57.19, 20.</note>
                        <hi>There is no peace vnto the sinner, saith my God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Lastly, there is the punishment of sinne, whereof the Psal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mist speaketh,<note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 11.7.</note>
                        <hi>Ʋpon the vngodly he shall raine snares, fire and brimstone, storme and tempest: this shall be their portion to drinke.</hi> And our Sauiour saith<note n="d" place="margin">Mat. 13.41, 42.</note>

                     <p>ANswerable to the two considerations of sinne, namely,<note place="margin">Two kindes of redemption.</note> the corruption and punishment, there are also 2 kindes of redemption from sinne. The first is the taking away of the <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> corruption of our sinnes: from which Christ hath so perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purged his elect, that it shall neuer bee laid to their charge: yea, God when he looketh vpon vs, shall beholde no sinne in vs, according as it is written,<note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 5.8</note>
                        <hi>Yee were sometimes darkenes, but are now light in the Lord.</hi> And againe hee saith,<note n="b" place="margin">Eph. 5.25.26.27</note>
                        <hi>Christ loued the Church, and gaue himselfe for it, that he might sanctifie it, and cleanse it, by the washing of water through the word, that he might make it vnto himselfe a glorious Church, not hauing spot or wrinkle, or any such thing, but that it should bee holy and without blame.</hi> Hereto may be applied that of <hi>Malachy,</hi>
                        <note n="c" place="margin">Mal. 3.2.3</note>
                        <hi>He is like a purging fire, and likefullers sope: hee shall euen sine the sonnes of Leui, and purifie them as gold and siluer, that they may bring offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings vnto the Lord in righteousnes.</hi> To this no doubt <hi>Ezechiel</hi> also aimeth, where vnto Israel he pronounceth,<note n="d" place="margin">Eze. 36.25</note>

This is strange stupidity in a man of his degree: of whom I would gladly aske this question; Whether the Pope in his pardons forgiuing sinnes, and commanding the Angells to carry the soules immediately into heauen, of all those which dy in his warres, or conferre any thing vnto the same, doth egge then on to sinne? or doth the mercifull father, which payeth the debt of his imprisoned sonne, and deliuers him out of fetters, egge or prouoke his sonne to runne into debt againe? Such thoughts can neuer enter into the heart of him that is truely redeemed, as to say, I will sinne, because my sin is forgiuen me.

                     <p>AS it is most manifest, that Iesus Christ only hath power and might to subdue our spirituall enemies: so he onely hath proprietie of right, to redeeme vs from our captiuitie. The Law giuen to <hi>Moses</hi> concerning ciuill redemption or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daineth,<note place="margin">Leuit. 25.</note> that the Father shall redeeme the Sonne, the brother the brother, and the kinsman the kinsman, and so the next of kinde is alwaies the redeemer. Now what is the Law, but the couering, the shadow, the veile of the Gospell? As one well saith; the Law is the Gospell hidden, the Gospell is the Law reuealed. Therefore as in the shadow, so in the substance; as in the resemblance, so in the nature of the things themselues, the nearest of bloud must bee the Redeemer. Now who is there, O who is there, in the vvhole vniuersitie of things, in heauen, in earth, or vnder the earth, so nearely ioyned vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to vs, as our Christ?</p>
                     <p>Our parents are not so neare; for of them wee haue recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued flesh indeed, yet we haue receiued nothing but flesh, the worst, and beastly part: but of Christ we haue receiued the spirit, yea, his owne spirit, as saith the Apostle;<note n="a" place="margin">Gal. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Secondly, though the generation euen of the body it selfe be from our parents, yet the creation at the first, and the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation now is of God. So saith the Psalmist,<note n="b" place="margin">Psal. 139.12.</note>
                        <hi>My reynes are thine, thou hast couered me in my Mothers Wombe.</hi> Wee haue receiued of our Parents dead earth; and that, which either by misordered natures errour, might haue beene a Monster, or by casualtie of euill fortune, haue proued abortiue.

                     <p>Thirdly, wee are in Christ, and Christ in vs: but our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is onely from our Parents, and not in them. Who can say, I am in my Father? but<note n="e" place="margin">Act. 17.18.</note>
                        <hi>in him we liue, and moue, and haue our being.</hi> For this cause <hi>Aratus</hi> calleth vs the diuine Progeny. And <hi>Porphiry</hi> saith, that men by nature are Gods, sauing that mortalitie is cast vpon them.</p>
                     <p>If we be nearer to Christ then our parents, wee are much nearer to Christ, then to our brethren; for from them wee haue receiued nothing: but Christ calleth vs his sonnes; nay, vnto vs is giuen <hi>a</hi>

                     <p>Lastly, Christ is not onely nearer to vs then our parents, our brethren, and our kinsfolke: but he is nearer to vs then we are to our selues. For in respect of the continuall vvarre betweene the sensuall part of the Soule, and the reasonable, and of the horrible corruption and deprauation of sinne, we are strangers to ourselues, vnlike to our selues. But Christ in the spotlesse purity of his innocent manhood (such as Man was in his creation) is nearer to vs in our nature,<note place="margin">I doe not herein compare our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in nature with the perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the nature of Christ, but on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that we were by nature perfect in creatiō, though he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

As is plainely proued in <hi>Salomon</hi> the sonne of <hi>Dauid;</hi> of whose posteritie the Lord saith,<note n="a" place="margin">2. Sam. 7.14. Psal. 89.32, 33.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, as he suffered by his enemies afflicting, so did he by his friends forsaking him.<note n="q" place="margin">Psal. 38 11.</note>

                     <p>Thirdly, Christ suffered in all his humanitie,<note place="margin">The horrible af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction of Christ.</note> and in all the naturalities that belong thereto. In his holy name he suffered by blasphemies, in his honour by reproches, in his goods by stripping and spoiling: hee suffered in his Soule, by extreme heauinesse; yea, such a cloud of sorrow did ouercast his spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, as neuer any heart was couered with: hee suffered in his body not onely by stripes and wounds, nippings and spit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, as though contempt, and smart did striue which should haue the mastery ouer him: but by pearcing also his hands and feete, the most sinowie parts of his body; and therefore

Thus you see, hee suffered in euery member, and in euery sense of his humane nature: inwardly bearing the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiest burthens, that euer were borne of any man; the sinne of the whole world, the curse of God, which euen rent his soule in peeces.

                     <p>Finally, three reasons there are alleaged, why Christs suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering was more grieuous then any other.<note n="t" place="margin">Albert. in Mat. <hi>26</hi>
                        </note> First, because hee was more innocent then any other. And therefore (as<note n="v" place="margin">

                        <hi>Henricus de Vrimaria</hi> well collecteth) <hi>Christ suffered more then any Sainct; for that there was no cause, why he should suffer at all: but there are many causes, why Saincts should suffer.</hi> Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, the excellency of his great honour made his suffering the greater; for greater is the affliction, when the honourable are abased, then when the vile and base are wronged.

Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Christs spirit most deeply aboue all other, had the sense &amp; feeling of sorrowe, because it was most pure, intellectuall, and sensitiue.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, the Prophet <hi>Esay</hi> witnesseth, that<note n="w" place="margin">Esa. 40.2</note>
                        <hi>Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem hath receiued double at the hand of the Lord for all her sinne.</hi> Which cannot be otherwise vnderstood, but of the superabun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant satisfaction of Christ, sufficient vnto all them that lay hold thereon; euen as in <hi>Ieremy</hi> also the Lord vnto <hi>Israel</hi> the type of his Church, promiseth deliuerance;<note n="x" place="margin">Ier. 16</note> but first hee will sufficiently reward their shamefull blasphemy.

                        <hi>The priest that neuer did good,</hi> but only sayd the howres of the virgin, going ouer a Riuer to committ wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, falling into the water, and there perishing, yet remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred his accustomed deuotions, &amp; died with the salutations of the virgin in his mouth. He is brought before Christ, he is accused by the diuells, hee is defended by the virgin, the matter is brought to this period; The virgin challengeth a promise of Christ, that where he findeth, there hee iudgeth. Wherefore this man howsoeuer vngratious his life were, hee ended it in my praises. If the diuells will not beleeue, let them looke into his mouth. They did so, and there found written in letters of gold; Haile <hi>Mary</hi> full of grace: and so the dead Man was set free from Sathans tyranny. The like story <hi>Ia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobus de Ʋoragine</hi> in the Legend of <hi>Lombardy</hi> telleth of an English priest, who was suspended by the Archbishop of <hi>Cā<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terbury,</hi>

Wherefore she appeared to her deuout suspended priest, and sent him to the Archbishop, requiring that hee should absolue her chaplaine by the same token, that she the blessed virgin had secretly sowed the shirt of haire, which the Archbishop made vnto himselfe to do penance in, and had left the needle hanging at a red thred. Of another Bishop the same authour reporteth,<note n="b" place="margin">Idē videre est in Prompt exēp. de mirac. virg.</note> that when hee had suspended a priest from his function, that could onely say the office of our Lady, &amp; none other, the virgin appeared to the Bishop and threatned him, that he shold dye within thirty daies, if he did not restore the said priest againe vnto his office.

                        </note> came to the diuell to obtaine riches, and being by the diuell required to renounce God, he did so: but thou hast not yet performed all (sayth the diuell) the worke is yet vnperfect: thou must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce his Mother also, for she it is that doth vs the greatest hurte; for whom her sonne would condemne by iustice, she doth by mercy saue.</p>

                     <p>My fourth proofe is, their publique worship, wherein when they offer those preheminences to Saints, which the word of God giueth only vnto Christ, what other constructi<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>on can be made, but that they esteeme of Saints as of Christ? The Roman Breuiarie of euery Confessor singeth,<note n="q" place="margin">Ro. Bre. in com. cōfat port if. Sar. post lect. quicquid igitur.</note>

Now if this bee be applied vnto Saints, what do they else, but thereby make them capable of the praise, of the honour, of the office, and of the excellencie of Christ?</p>

                     <p>Who seeth not this blasphemie? The power which by the preaching of the word, was giuen to the Apostles and Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters of Christ in this life, is by the Missall giuen vnto them also after this life by absolute command; so that they are made eternall Priests. It is giuen to them, I say, not by mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration of the word, as here on earth: but by commande<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and power, by their word and authoritie; and so they are made omnipotent and almighty Priests. It is giuen vnto them being absent from vs, and departed out of this life, to heare euery prayer, to see euery necessitie, to be present in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery place; and so they are made incomprehensible Priests, and of an infinite wisedome.

                     <p>An Aduocate is hee, who either pleads the cause before the iudge, or arbitrates the businesse in priuate colloquie. Of the first the Canonist speaketh,<note n="a" place="margin">Sext. decret. de poenis t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Mediation is, when two things (formerly diuided and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered) are made one; as the poynt maketh two lines one, and the line maketh two extensions one. So the necke ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth the members and head one body: the body maketh the roots and the branches one tree: the glue maketh two peeces one arrowe. And thus Christ is called a Mediatour, because he hath made many coniunctions in himselfe.</p>
                     <p>First, he hath conioyned the manhood vnto the Godhead in one person, which is of all coniunctions the greatest. It is great power to ioyne contrarie elements together in one body: it is greater power to ioyne them to a spirit heauenly created: but to ioyne them to an vncreated, immortall, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite, glorious spirit, the God of Spirits, notwithstanding the infinite disparitie betwixt them; this is the greatest coniuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that may be.

                     <p>Secondly, a Mother &amp; a Virgin, two vnreconcileable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions are vnited in one woman by Iesus Christ. For like the<note n="*" place="margin">Num. 17.8 Exod. 32</note> Rodde of <hi>Aaron,</hi> which budded &amp; blossomed, when it grew not on the tree: and like the tables of <hi>Moses,</hi> which were engrauen without a penne: so the blessed virgin became a Mother without the knowledge of any man, to make vp the fourefould creation of <hi>Man,</hi> witnessed in the Scripture. The first, neither from Man nor woman,<note place="margin">Gen. 1 Gen. 2 Gen. 4.

                     <p>The third coniunction is of the Lawe and the Gospell in Iesus Christ; according as the Christian Poet well obserueth,<note n="e" place="margin">Sic vetus at{que} no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uū coniungit gratia Christi.</note> The ould and new testaments are by the grace of Christ conioyned.</p>
                     <p>The Fourth Coniunction in Christ, is of the sheep and the Goates in one fould: the Oxe and the Asse at one Crib: the two walls of the building, Iewes and Gentiles, vnder one head corner stone.

                        <hi>He is our peace that hath made of both one, and hath broken the stop of the partition wall, in abrogating through his flesh the hatred, that is, the law of commandements, which standeth in ordinances; for to make of twaine one new man in himselfe, so ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king peace, that hee might reconcile both vnto God in one body by his Crosse, and slay hatred thereby.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftlie, in Christ the righteousnes and the mercy, the loue and the iustice of God are reconciled together, according to that of the psalmist, <hi>Mercy and truth are mett together, righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnes &amp; peace haue kissed each other.</hi>

                     <p>Sixtly, in Christ the fayth of Man is conioyned vnto all these things, effecting in vs vndoubted assent vnto these wondrous workes of God, euen beyond sense the light of nature: beyond reason, the perfection of sense: beyond faith, the puritie of reason: beyond hope, the life-bloud of faith: beyond conceit, the farre stretching hand of hope: yea, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the thought of Man, the quickest and the nimblest o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration of the Soule.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Plato</hi> and his followers did beleeue, that betwixt mankind and the supreme God, there were two kindes of Mediators; <hi>Daemones,</hi> and <hi>Heroes;</hi> Diuels, and soules of excellent men. And <hi>Philo Iudaeus</hi> saith, the Iewes had three Mediators to God; the Fathers goodnesse: the great founders of King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes: and the workes of the penitent. But these are the dreames and fictions of such as meane to deceiue, and to be deceiued. For Angels are of two sorts; either Good, or Euill. The good are they which are blessed within the vnaccessible light, and are holy Ministers in the sight of God: the euill are wicked and vngodly spirits: but neither of them can be Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diators for vs. For the first kinde, they cannot bee Mediators for vs; because though they bee glorious and eternall vvith God, yet of his nature they are not. Now with the other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme they haue no manner of agreement. For they are nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of our substance and nature, neither are they infirme and corruptible as Man is. The euill Angels haue many impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments also, why they cānot be mediators. For though they be corrupt and sinfull, as Man; eternall and immortall, as God: yet they participate of the nature of neither of the extremes: and if they did, yet can they not be mediators for vs to God, that are seducers and tempters to euill, which is most con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to God.</p>
                     <p>For the second kinde of Mediators, the soules of illustri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and excellent men, the reasons before touched in the Chapter of the Redemption of Man doe sufficiently proue, that they cannot mediate.

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXIIII.</hi> The manner how Christ our Mediatour doth ioyne vs vnto God.</head>
                     <p>I Am now come vnto the burning Mountain, the mystery of all mysteries, which the tongues of Men and Angelles cannot sufficiently expresse: yet I trust, God will giue mee grace to shadow out vnto you some smal obscure <hi>Idea</hi> ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; such as my dimme eies can comprehend, and my vncir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcised lips with harsh and vnproper words, concerning this high and incomprehensible argument, expresse. It is a very perfect incorporation, when of two things which must bee made one, each groweth into the other, and assumeth what is anothers, communicating also their natures toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. So the graffe groweth into the tree, and the tree grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth into the graffe: so wine and water are together blended; wine taking of the taste of water, and water sauouring of the sweetnes of the wine, so that both in substance and qualitie they are vnseparably vnited. After the same manner (sauing that earthly similitudes fully expresse not spiritual things) Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:2645:84"/> Christ and his Church are together vnited; God, an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created, an infinite, a powerfull spirit knitteth himselfe vnto Man, fleshly, mortall, finite, weak: and inspireth into man a certaine liuely and powerfull vigour,<note place="margin">Faith, hope, and loue.</note> by which he againe is knit also vnto God.</p>
                     <p>There are wise and learned Philosophers,<note place="margin">Vid. Io. Picum Mirandul. in <hi>1.</hi> cap. lib. <hi>4.</hi> Heptap.</note> who of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of the humane soule vnto the body, teach, that it is done by mediation of the vitall spirits, more grosse and carnall then the Soule, and somewhat more spirituall and ghostly then the body. How true this is, I wil not contēd: but sure I am, that by Iesus Christ inferior to God in his holy hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, superiour to Man in the dignity of his person, this vnion and coniunction is made. But this is a generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunctiō, in which not only the true members of Christ, but all mankinde seemeth to be knit vnto God. Wherefore this is not the effectuall and entire vnion which wee haue with CHRIST. For though in this, God seemeth to come neare vnto Man, yet there are many impediments, which suffer vs not hereby to be vnseparably ioyned vnto God. Christ in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed hath taken flesh and was made Man, yet betwixt his manhood and ours there is great difference; his body and soule holy, ours corrupt: his humanity pure, ours impure: he Man without sinne, we men, but sinners. Christ died not of necessity, for hee is omnipotent: hee died not as owing death a debt, for hee was without sinne. Wherefore his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity was of it self immortal, (but that by dispensation he made it mortal and gaue it to dy) we are mortal and of neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sity must die.</p>
                     <p>Christ therefore after a double manner hath vnited him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vnto vs. First, in nature,<note place="margin">Christ vnited vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore secondly, hee vniteth himselfe to his Church, and to euery member thereof, and to none other by communication of his spirit. For as a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the naturall Man, though it growe into the same bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and be couered with the same skinne, yet liueth not, and
<pb n="116" facs="tcp:2645:85"/> is not to be reckoned as a part, except it be quickened by the same soule which animateth all the rest: so the effectuall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Christ is wrought by the spirit of Christ, and the grace thereof communicated vnto vs. Mariage is the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication not onely of bodies, but of loue and affection; and they are verely one, which haue not onely one matter, but also one forme, one efficient, one end, &amp; one effect. Such is our copulation with CHRIST.<note place="margin">The materiall Coniunction.</note> Hee hath taken our flesh, he hath giuen vs his Spirit, working in our hearts and quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vs together in God, and to the glory of his name. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> therefore saith,<note place="margin">1. Cor. 2.16.</note>
                        <hi>Wee haue the minde of of Christ.</hi> And in his Epistle to the <hi>Ephesians</hi> hee compareth the Church<note n="b" place="margin">Ephes. 4.16.</note> to a naturall body,<note place="margin">The formall Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction</note> whereof the members being knit and coupled together by euery ioint for the fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture thereof; according to the effectuall power which is in the measure of euery part, receiueth the increase of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, to the edifying of it selfe in loue. What can bee more plaine? We see, as Christ doth participate with vs in the flesh, that thereby he might satisfie in our owne nature for sinne: so all that are Christs haue also the Spirit of Christ, and doe participate of the effectual inward power of his grace, which doth enlighten our vnderstanding, and raiseth vp our saith, to lay hold vpon him, and to cleaue vnto him. For as the head is the principall seate of the Soule: so is Christ of the Spirit of God, from whom it is dispersed into the whole Church, <hi>Anselme</hi> well saith, all that beleeue in Christ, by secret inspiration and communication of ghostly grace, are iustified; because they all are one spirit with him. Wherefore,<note n="c" place="margin">Ioh. 14.20.</note>
                        <hi>I am in my Father</hi> (saith he) <hi>and you in me.</hi> And this is the cause why hee is called <hi>Immanuell,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>This coniunction Christ by many excellent Parables hath set out vnto vs. For he calleth himselfe<note n="f" place="margin">Ioh. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>.</note> the bread of life, his flesh meate, and his bloud drinke indeed. As then our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall foode is incorporate into vs, and groweth into our
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:2645:85"/> substance, and wee into it: so spiritually receiued by a liuely faith, Christ becomes one with vs, and we one with him.</p>
                     <p>In the Gospell he intituleth himselfe<note n="g" place="margin">Ioh. 15.5.</note> a <hi>Ʋine,</hi> and his Disciples branches. For because the branches and the Vine are one, nourished with the same sap, couered with the same barke: so Christ and his chosen are one; because they haue the same spirit, being clothed with the same nature.</p>
                     <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> in the same manner declareth this vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on vnto vs, when he saith,<note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 11.3.</note>
                        <hi>God is the head of Christ, &amp; Christ is the head of Man.</hi> So that by a due and seemely subordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, wee are one with Christ, and Christ is one with God.

Why then here, O taste and see how sweet the Lord is: behold (I say) Mercy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond mercy, and grace beyond grace, which hath made vs himselfe; and our members, members of his owne body.

Wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> the Apostle maketh it euident by a comparison;<note n="d" place="margin">1. Cor. 15.21.</note>
                        <hi>By man came death, by Man came also the resurrection of the dead.</hi> This is a plaine resemblance betwixt <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Christ;</hi> that as the first Man alone was our mediator to damnation: so the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Man was our Mediator to saluation.

                        <hi>is no peace</hi> (saith the Lord) <hi>vnto the wicked.</hi> Now this reparation required as great humiliation for the purging of sinne, as was presumption in the transgression by sinne. But the presumption proceeded from the lowest of all creatures endued with reason, which is Man, against the highest rationall or reasonable Essence, which is God. Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:2645:86"/> it was necessarie, that from the equalititie of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, the Mediator should abase himselfe to the lowest estate of man. For which cause he saith,<note n="g" place="margin">Zach. 13.7.</note>
                        <hi>Arise, O sword, vpon my Shepheard, &amp; vpon the man that is my fellow.</hi> And the Apostle saith,<note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 5.8.</note>
                        <hi>Though hee were the Sonne, yet learned hee obedience.</hi> Wherefore it is euident, that none but God can be Mediator vnto God; and God is one.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, if a meere creature could be a Mediator, then <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>3</label> wee should bee more beholding to a creature, then to our Creator: and in vs a creature should doe a more excellent worke, then the Creator; because it is more excellent to bee made a righteous Man, then to be made a Man.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, hee is a perfect Mediator, who prayeth and <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>4</label> intercedeth for all other, and none for him: But Christ onely hath this prerogatiue; therefore Christ onely is our Mediator.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, <hi>Bernard</hi> defineth a true Mediator, to bee such as <label type="milestone">

                     <p>Sixtly, it is against the dignitie of Iesus Christ to make any <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Reason </seg>6</label> other mediator vnto God. For thereby we acknowledge that God is well pleased in others, satisfied in others, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicateth himselfe to vs in others, as he doth in Christ. Wher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, as he dishonoureth God, who maketh many Creators: so he doth more dis-honour God, who maketh many waies of new being, and of new creation, which is the greatest of all the workes of God. <hi>Sedulius</hi> saith, that if the Soule yeeld any thing at all of that which it oweth to God, vnto any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, it commits adulterie. As it is then Heresie to say, God made the world by Angels, or by any other but by himselfe: so to say, that Christ procureth the Saluation of the world by any, or with any but himselfe, is Hereticall doctrine. Yea, to make others mediators to Christ himselfe, is derogation from his infinite &amp; vnspeakeable loue: as though any other could be nearer to vs in loue and charitie then our Christ; or that we might more boldly call vpon any other then him.</p>

                        </note> that two things requisite in a Mediator are wanting in the Godhead of Christ. First, the nature of mediation. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, the Office and meanes of coniunction. The nature of a Mediator is wanting (saith he) in the Godhead of Christ; because Christ as God doth not differ from the Father. But the mouth of this Cauill is easily stopt, for it is a meere falla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, which the Logicians call <hi>à malè diuisis, ad bene coniuncta.</hi> For when we say, Christ is a Mediator in both natures, wee speake of Christ God and Man, one person: neither nature in it selfe meerely and alone considered can be Mediator be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt
<pb n="122" facs="tcp:2645:88"/> God and Man as <hi>Haymo</hi> well saith);<note n="c" place="margin">Christus Iesus per hoc quod homo pariter et Deus est, Mediater noster est, verba patris refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rē ad nos, et modo nostra ad illū Isay. in Heb <hi>12.</hi>
                        </note> Iesus Christ, by that he is God and Man together, is our Mediatour, brin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging the words of the Father vnto vs, and reporting ours vnto God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Christ Iesus though hee differ not in the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of the diuinity from God; yet he differeth in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of the Sonne from the Father. And therefore when we say, Christ is a Mediatour in both natures, we say as much, as that Christ the sonne of God doth mediate vnto his Father for vs.</p>
                     <p>To the purging of the filthy leper<note n="d" place="margin">Leu. 14.6.</note> in the law, the priest must take two sparrowes, and one of them hee must kill ouer pure water in an earthen vessell: after, hee must take the liue Sparrow with Cedar wood, and a scarlet lace, and hysop, and with these, and the liuing Sparrow dipt in the bloud of the dead sparrow, he must sprinkle the leper seauen times &amp; clense him, and let goe the liuing Sparrow into the broad field. This is a mysticall allegorie, telling vs that in Christ there are two natures; the manhood, which was offered and became a dead sacrifice for sinne; the Godhead, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sents the sacrifice, makes it acceptable, and offers it to the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. <hi>Eusebius Emissenus</hi> well saith,<note n="e" place="margin">Euseb.

The Godhead (sayth he) could no more suffer with the Manhood, then the Sunne beame which shineth on the wood, is cut, when the wood is cut. And <hi>Ʋigilantius</hi> excellentlie saith, Christs passion did
<pb n="123" facs="tcp:2645:88"/> pertaine to the flesh, in respect of the nature suffering; and vnto the word, in respect of the person. <hi>Irenaeus</hi> saith,<note n="h" place="margin">In lib. <hi>3</hi> cap. <hi>2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                                 <desc>•</desc>

                        </note> that if Man had not ouercome the diuell, the diuell had not been iustly ouercome: but if God had not giuen saluation, the manhood had not sufficiently attayned it. I wil conclude with that of <hi>Albert;</hi> That Christ touched the leper (saith he) it was the act of his humanity: that by touching he cured, it was the act of his diuinity. So did the coniunction of the diuine nature to the humane make the satisfaction infinite; and for whome his Manhood did suffer to the vttermost, them his Godhead doth iustifie to the vttermost. Thus Christ both God and Man in both natures doth mediate.</p>
                     <p>The second obstacle that <hi>Aquinas</hi> obserueth in the deity of Christ, for which he cannot mediate betwixt God and vs is, because the office of a Mediatour is to ioyne two extrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mes, by giuing that to one, which is the others. Now that (sayth hee) cannot bee done of the diuine nature, but only in the humane nature, which differeth from God in nature, and from Man in dignity. But it must bee still remembred which I spake of heretofore, that Christ is not diuided from himself to become our mediatour, but in his owne person of two natures is the<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 28.12.13.</note> ladder of <hi>Iabob,</hi> by whome our praiers ascend to God, and Gods blessings descend vpon vs.</p>
                     <p>The Apost. doth plainely shew, that Christ is our mediator according to the forme of mediation in his diuine nature. For he sayth,<note n="i" place="margin">Heb. 9.14.</note>
                        <hi>By the eternall spirit</hi> he <hi>offered himselfe without spotte to God.</hi> And againe, in <hi>these last dayes God hath spoken to vs by his sonne, whome he made heyre of all things. Who</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Heb. 1.2. <hi>et</hi> ver. 3.</note>
                        <hi>being the brightnes of the glory and the engraued form of his person, both by himselfe purged our sinnes, and sitteth at the right hand of the Maiesty in the highest places.</hi> Here you see, first, that God spake vnto vs by his sonne, and this sonne is God. For so Iohn witnesseth,<note n="l" place="margin">Io. 1.1.</note>
                        <hi>That word was God.</hi> Therefore if God speake vnto vs by God, God is a mediatour vnto vs from God. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly the same that hee spake to vs by, hee purged vs by: but hee spake vnto vs by the brightnes of the glory; ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he purged vs by the brightnes of the glorie. Thirdly: that
<pb n="124" facs="tcp:2645:89"/> which redeemeth vs, sitteth at the right hand of the Maiestie of God. Now though the right hand of God be taken for the excellencie of reward, yet the right hand of the Maiestie of God, is taken for the vnity of the godhead;<note n="m" place="margin">De Christ. lib. <hi>1.</hi> cap. <hi>16.</hi> verb. Res<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond. illud.</note> As <hi>Bellarmin</hi> himselfe truly collecteth out of those wordes of the Apostle, <hi>Then shall the sonne also himselfe be subiect vnto him;</hi> that is, in his glorie Christ as Man shall be subiect vnto God. Wherfore the sitting at the right hand of the Maiestie of God, must needs be vnderstood of the Godhead of Christ. And then I may well conclude; God spake vnto vs by the brightnes, &amp; purged vs by the brightnes, that sitteth at the right hand of his Maiestie; therefore the brightnes is the Mediatour, euen God himselfe.</p>
                     <p>The work of Mediation was wrought in the humanity, as far as cōcerneth sorrowing, suffering, &amp; dying: It was wroght also by the Godhead, as concerning making of the sacrifice infinite in price, efficacious of so great a worke, and in ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing his owne body againe for our iustification, which hee gaue for our redemption. Neither doth it hence follow (as <hi>Bellarmin</hi> and <hi>Kellison</hi> doe foolishlie inforce) that there bee then three Mediatours, or that there is a confusion of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in Christ, or that Christ in his Godhead is inferiour to the Father.<note n="*" place="margin">Let no papist here accuse me, that I make the Godhead of the Sō vnequal to the Godhead of the Father, which I do not: but I only speake of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiall respect of the Father and the Son.</note> For though the Father and the sonne be equall in essence, yet the sonne in office is inferiour to the Father.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Bellarmin</hi> imagineth,<note n="n" place="margin">Lib. <hi>5</hi> de Christ. mediat. cap. <hi>5.</hi> ad finē Igitur vide.</note> that as the same worke of a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate person, &amp; of a King, differeth much in respect of the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie that the person of a King bringeth with it: yet the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality of a king doth not send forth any substantial influence into the work: so the sacrifice of Christ had exceeding digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty from the Godhead, though it were wrought by the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane nature, and no waie by the diuine.</p>
                     <p>This similitude agreeth not with the purpose.

                     <p>The truth is, that in the Law there were diuers Mediators betwixt God and Man. For <hi>Moses</hi> was not an immediate me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator betwixt God and the people. But when it is said, God appeared, or God spake vnto <hi>Moses,</hi> it is alwaies meant, that an Angell appeared, or an Angell the substitute of God spake
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:2645:93"/> vnto <hi>Moses.</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Vid. Luther. in <hi>3.</hi> ad Galatas.</note> Angels therefore were mediators betwixt God and <hi>Moses,</hi> to bring the Law vnto him. And of this mediation Saint <hi>Paul</hi> speaketh;<note n="c" place="margin">Gal. 3.19.</note>
                        <hi>It was ordained by Angels in the hand of a Mediator.</hi> So <hi>Stephen</hi> telleth the Iewes,<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 7.35.</note> that God sent <hi>Moses</hi> by the hand, that is, by the dispensation or ministerie of an Angell.</p>
                     <p>The Angels were subordinate vnto God, because<note n="o" place="margin">Exod. 33.20.</note>
                        <hi>Moses</hi> (though with extraordinarie sanctification adorned) could not stand before the presence of God. And <hi>Moses</hi> was subor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinate vnto the Angels, because the people (though they also were sanctified) could not sustaine,<note place="margin">Exod. 20.</note> nor abide the glorie of Angels deliuering the Law in fire, in lightning, in thundring, in tempest and in earthquake. Nay, this<note n="*" place="margin">Exod. 34.33.</note> glorious appariti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made the face of <hi>Moses</hi> so resplendent, that hee was also compelled to couer his face with a veile, that it might bee a Mediator betwixt him and the people. For on his face it selfe (so brightly shining) they could not looke.</p>
                     <p>Now these sundry Mediatours in the first Couenant were necessarie; for that the first couenant deliuered the glory of God, and the power of God to iudgement and to vengeance: It set forth the puritie, and the spotlesse rigour of his vnflexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble righteousnesse: It thundred out the Law, the curse, the death which was due to all mankinde. So that the deliuerers thereof were as intolerable to the people, as the things them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues were. Neither were they properly Mediators as Christ is; but messengers to denounce, and declare vnto the people the righteousnesse of God, and his wrath against sinne. But the Gospell is a couenant of sweetnesse and peace, wherein God weakeneth and humbleth himselfe (as it were) and hath sent his owne Sonne in the cloud of flesh, by which God is communicable and familiar with vs; that thereby we might behold and draw neere vnto himselfe. And this is the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence betwixt the first, and the second Couenant, and the mediations of them both.</p>
                     <p>Now therefore it is to be considered, that in the New Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stament, though there be diuers Ministers, yet none is called a Mediator but Christ onely; for that in none wee can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:2645:93"/> God, or come neare vnto him, but in CHRIST. As it is absurd and traiterous ambition in an Earle or a Duke, to bee called a King, because hee is a subordinate power to the King: so it is blasphemous and sacrilegious in our reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, to call any other but CHRIST, by the glorious and soueraigne title of a Mediator. <hi>Augustine</hi> very soundly tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheth,<note n="e" place="margin">In <hi>8.</hi> cap. contra Epist. Parmen.</note> it is an intolerable blasphemy to say, Bishops are mediators betwixt God and the people.</p>
                     <p>Let vs now proceede further vnto other Reasons, which proue Saints deceased not to bee ministeriall Mediators for vs vnto GOD. The Office of ministration ceaseth in men, when men cease to be among the liuing. And hereof are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny probations. First, the soules of the Saints,<note place="margin">Apoc. 14.13.</note> after they bee dis-burdened of the flesh, enioy an euerlasting Sabbath and rest from their labours. Ministration then ceaseth with them, which belongeth to trauellers in the way: glory and thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuing remaineth to them, as vnto Citizens of the new Ieru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem in the Paradise of happinesse.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> maketh this difference betwixt Christ and all other Priests;<note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 7.23.24.</note>
                        <hi>for that other Priests were forbidden by death to endure, but this Man, because hee endu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth for euer, hath an euerlasting Priesthood.</hi> Now if the Saints being dis-burdened of the flesh, and dead, doe yet still make intercession for vs, their Priesthood endureth still, as Christs Priesthood endureth still; and there is no difference betwixt our High Priest Christ and other Priests, in respect of conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance and indurance. Which if it were granted, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle should bee found a false witnesse concerning Christ. An impietie that no Christian eare can endure.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, no place of Scripture teacheth, that the departed Saints are ministeriall Mediators in Heauen, or that they pray for vs there as Mediators. Neither haue wee example of any, that euer in the Gospell of IESVS CHRIST was taught to call, or did attempt to call on Saints to be his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisteriall Mediatours. <hi>Augustine</hi> acknowledgeth;<note place="margin">August.</note> whom should I finde that might reconcile me to thee? Shall I goe to the Angels? With what prayer? with what Sacraments?
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:2645:94"/> as though hee should say, in all the holy volume there is no Ordinance, there is no Rite, there is no Ceremonie nor fashion, according to which any should bee worshipped but God alone.</p>
                     <p>But what goe I about to beate the ayre? Or why doe I sight with this <hi>Chymera</hi> and phantasticall imagination of ministeriall Mediatorship? whereas indeede they make Saints full, perfect, absolute, and proper Mediators in all their worship. And this is euidently proued by all the Attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes, which can be giuen to a perfect Mediator.</p>
                     <p>It is the Office of a perfect and absolute Mediator, to vnite by his merits and prayer sinners to God; But this they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge Saints to doe.

                        <note place="margin">Answere to the fourth Limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note>AN ancient Father truely &amp; wisely saith, there is a double kinde of blindnes, when men see not the things that are, &amp; yet would seeme to see the things that are not. And surely this miserable darknesse is fallen vpon the Romish fraternity, who cannot behold the great High Priest and Bishop of our soules at the right hand of God, making intercession for his Church continually, and yet can see swarmes and armies of other Mediatours commending their cause to God. It is no iust defence or Apologie to say, they doe not esteeme so base<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of the Mediation of Christ, as to beseech him to pray for them; seeing that Christ doth both pray for vs as a Mediator:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:2645:97"/> and giueth to vs as our God. Hee prayeth in his humanitie, wherein he is stil inferiour to God: he giueth in his diuinity, wherein he is equall to God: his prayer hath relation to his person: his giuing hath reference to the substance of his Dei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Wherefore the Apostle saith,<note n="a" place="margin">Heb 7.25.</note>
                        <hi>Hee is able perfectly to saue those, that come vnto God by him, seeing he euer liueth to make in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercession for them.</hi> And in another place;<note n="b" place="margin">Rom 8.34.</note>
                        <hi>Christ is at the right hand of God, and maketh request also for vs.</hi> Vpon which words <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith, the Apostle makes vs secure both of the Father, and the Sonne. For before he said, that God doth iustifie: and now, that the Sonne doth intercede.</p>
                     <p>Two parts there are of Christs eternall Priesthood. The first to Sacrifice: the second to pray. The Act of sacrificing was but once done, and neuer to bee renued; hee himselfe thereof hauing witnessed,<note n="c" place="margin">Io. 19.30.</note>
                        <hi>It is finished.</hi> And the Father also doth acknowledge the same. For the sweet<note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 29.38.</note> and fragrant odor of the <hi>Holocaust</hi> is euer before GOD; whereof the daily Sacrifice<note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 12.11.</note> was a type and figure. And hee in this respect is tearmed<note n="f" place="margin">Apoc. 13.8.</note>
                        <hi>a Lambe, which was slaine from the beginning of the world.</hi> But the second part of Christs Priestly Office, which is prayer, is now in doing, and shall euer con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till the accomplishment of our redemption, and that his whole body be glorified with him their head. Wherefore Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> saith,<note n="g" place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.1.</note>
                        <hi>Wee haue an Aduocate with the Father, Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ the righteous.</hi> Now then the Romanists, if they please, neede not feare to come to this open fountaine and professed Aduocate: and they may bee bold to beseech him to pray for them; which if they doe not, it is their owne fault. And whereas they account it a debasing, or the disgrace of our Redeemer, in his holy humanitie to pray for vs, there is no such cause. For his prayer is infinitely excellent aboue all the prayers, that we, or any other Priests can send vp vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God; and that for many considerations.</p>
                     <p>First, Christs prayer hath satisfaction ioined with it, it is<note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 8 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>

                        <hi>odor requiescentiae,</hi> the sauour of rest, which was figured in the Sacrifice of <hi>Noah,</hi> wherein God is fully contented. But our prayer is the prayer of a loathsome and corrupt Leper,
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:2645:98"/>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Leu. 13.</note> who must haue his clothes rent, the head hare a couering before his lips, and cry; <hi>I am vncleane, I am vncleane.</hi> Neither may we offer it vp, but with the acknowledgement of our corruption.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, as wee our selues are vnworthy, so our prayers are vnperfect: but the prayer of Christ is absolute, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. For<note n="*" place="margin">Col. 2.3. Iob. 16.30.</note> he knoweth all our necessities, nothing is hid from him.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, Christs prayer maketh all our prayers acceptable; as you reade in the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> that vnto the<note n="k" place="margin">Apoc. 8.3.</note>
                        <hi>Angell stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before the Altar, hauing a golden Censer, was much more o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dours giuen, that he should offer with the prayers of all Saints vpon the golden Altar, which is before the Throne.</hi> Which place <hi>Lyra</hi> their owne Glossator expoundeth of IESVS CHRIST, which came, that is (saith he) vnited flesh vnto himselfe, and stood before the Altar: that is, before himselfe, and repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>senteth the prayers of the Saints vnto the Father. By this it appeareth sufficiently, how vaine their excuse is, who feare to make Christ their Oratour to the Father, according to the Gospell; and yet feare not to make men their aduocates, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trarie to the Gospell.</p>
                     <p>The Law ordaineth,<note n="l" place="margin">Leuit. 21.18.</note> that the Priest may not be lame of any of his members. But they haue shamelessely dismem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred and dissolued Iesus, taking from him one of the most ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent parts of his Priesthood, which is Intercession at the right hand of GOD by prayer for vs; the most sweet and soueraigne salue of all wounded consciences: and in place thereof haue put those to pleade our cause, and to pray as our Aduocates for vs, who haue no warrant for such an office.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the second part of this Limitation, wherein they pretend, that they come not to Saints, as vnto such as haue power to giue, but onely to pray; Let vs now examine it. And not to goe farther for examples, beeing compassed with such a cloud of witnesses, the matter in controuersie is made manifest in their publique <hi>Orison;</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Vid. Barth.

We ought not so to put one word for another, as God may be thereby dishonored, and his power giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to others: We ought not to put stumbling blockes before the blynd. But happy is that religion, wherin speake what you
<pb n="145" facs="tcp:2645:99"/> will, it is no blasphemy; <hi>for mentall reseruation helpeth all.</hi> If the Iewes had been allowed such interpretation of wordes, I thinke none should haue beene stoned to death by the Lawe<note n="g" place="margin">Leu. 24.15.</note> against cursing of God. But the truth is, they plainly desire, and will obtaine health and blessings from the Saints themselues. Wherfore <hi>Clichtoueus,</hi> who expoundeth all their Hymns and busines of the Masse, vpon the Hymne of one Martyr, <hi>Spe mercedis,</hi> and the sixt verse of the same;<note n="h" place="margin">Nō est morbus, quē nō curet, dum morborū nō obdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ret plagā disfidētia.</note>

                     <p>THe Mediation of Saints vnto Christ they do not deny, but acknowledge it as a positiō of their Church: which howsoeuer it carry a plausible shew of outward and worldly holines,<note place="margin">Ignorance of Christs office the first cause of the inuocation of Saints.</note> as acknowledging their vnworthines, and therfore sending Saints as their Oratours to Christ: yet the truth is, it doth proceed, first, out of ignorance of the office of Christ.
<pb n="147" facs="tcp:2645:100"/> For they looke on him, not as on an Aduocate, or a Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, or a Mediatour, or our reconciliation, our peace, our righteousnes: but as a truculent iudge, a seuere Censor, or a wrathfull executioner.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it proceedeth out of an opinion,<note place="margin">Desperation in the forgiuenes of sin, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Discip. de Temp.</hi> hath an History ready coi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned. For a grieuous sinner standing on a time before the I<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage of the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> with her Sonne in her armes, and seeing the bloud drop downe from the little childe into her lappe, as it did flowe from Christ vpon the Crosse, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazed said, Who hath done this? The Virgin answered, thou and other sinners, which crucifie my sonne more then the Iewes, are the cause of this. The sinner replyed, O Mother of mercy, intercede for mee. Shee answered, you sinners call me Mother of mercy, but you doe not cease to make me Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of sorrow and misery. Then turning her to her Sonne (the stonie mother to her stonie sonne) prayeth, but shee is not heard. She prayeth againe, and is answered; Cease Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, for I prayed vnto my Father, if it were possible, that the cup might passe from me, but he would not heare. The Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin prayeth againe, and is againe reiected. I (saith he) prayed vnto my Father the second time, that the cup might passe frō me, and was not heard. Well, the Virgin moueth the third time, and Christ the third time replyeth, I prayed vnto my Father the third time, that the cup might passe from me, and could not preuaile. Then, when no prayer would serue turne (for belike the Christ of stone cannot bee so mercifull as hee that is partaker of the flesh of his children) shee went vnto the Altar, and laid downe her sonne vpon the same, and fell downe at his feete. This the childe beholding said, Mother what wilt thou haue me doe? She said, I will with this sinner so long lye at thy feete, till thou grant pardon: to this the Sonne replyed, Not so Mother, it is ordained by the Law of
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:2645:101"/> God, that the Sonne should honour the Mother. Thus you see, first, that they come to the Mother, as more pittifull then the Sonne. Secondly, how hard Christ is become, and how inexorable vnto sinners: And lastly, the Virgin hath still her motherly commaund ouer him as a little childe.<note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 32.34.</note>

                     <p>AS I haue formerly shewed, that the merits of Saints are ioined together with the merits of Christ in the redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Man: so now must I in this Chapter proue, that Christ and the Saints are ioined together in Mediation.

                        <hi>of the Masse there are fiue partes; of which the first part is the offering of the bread and wine.</hi> To this I must replie, it is a needless thing to commend vnto God, that which they meane not to offer vnto God: that which they know of force by the power of the wordes must perish and vanish away. And in the whole Gospell and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall volume of the new Testament, there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement, no example, to offer bread vnto God; it is a mere Iudaicall tradition without any warrant of the word of God.

                        <hi>There may bee another interpretation</hi> (saith <hi>he) fitted vnto this place, according to which the priest doth pray, that God would command these things, that is the body and bloud of his Sonne offered on the Altar, and there present, to bee brought vp by the ministerie of his holy Angells into his high Altar, which is heauen, where his seate and Throne is; to bee carried, I say, not by locall translation (for hee is there now sitting at the right hand of his Father crowned in glory and honour) but according to the gratious acceptance thereof. For when a Prince doth admitte gifts into his presence, it is a token that he reiects them not, but doth gratiouslie accept the same: &amp; the gifts, which hee abhorreth, he suffereth not to come into his presence. So then in that respect that they should bee accepted, the petiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is, that they should be brought into the sight of the diuine Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty, and of the high deity, by the ministery of Angells. For if they bee not repulsed by the indignity of him that offereth, but bee admitted into the diuine presence, they must bee altogether accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</hi> This opinion is receiued of all them, which thinke the Etimologie of the word, <hi>Missa,</hi> to come from the sending vp of the Sonne vnto the Father in the Masse.</p>
                     <p>Much wresting thou seest (Christian reader) there is to make an honest vnderstanding of this petition: and all that the best excuser <hi>Clichtouius</hi> can say, is this in effect; that for the very body of Christ the Angells must mediate: euen<note n="r" place="margin">Vid. Henr. Bullinger. de erroribus circa Missom.</note>
                        <pb n="157" facs="tcp:2645:105"/> the body that is on the Altar, that it may bee brought into Gods presence, not locally, but acceptably, lest in respect of the indignitie of the offerer, it should be repulsed from the diuine presence. For if it once gette into the presence of God, there is no doubt, but it will bee accepted.</p>
                     <p>By this which hath beene spoken it appeareth, that <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> euasion is a false and impudent figment of his owne, and that <hi>the carrying of these things into the high Altar,</hi> is either the vniting of his Manhood to the Godhead, as <hi>Odo:</hi> or the procuring of acceptance for it, and admission into the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence of God, as <hi>Clichtouius</hi> expoundeth.

Who would haue thought that the penne of a Christian man could leaue such blottes of blasphemie behind him? as to say, that Christ in respect of the offerer doth not please God. <hi>Incidit in Scyllam;</hi> to auoide one blasphemie, the Iesuite is carried into another: to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuse the imputation that Angels with them bee Mediatours for the Reall carrying of Christs body into Heauen, hee is driuen to saie, that they are Mediatours for the acceptance of Christs body: which because simply vnderstood, is as blasphemous as the other, now he mends it by saying, that Christs body may be vnaccepted in respect of the offerer; an hellish and diuelish speech, fitter for the barbarous mouth of an infidell Mahometane, then the penne of a Christian. Though wee and our seruice bee often tymes hatefull vnto God in respect of our manifould abominations: yet that our corruption should make Christ to the Father vnaccep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, is no lesse a sacrilegious speech, then false and vnproper. If he had said that the priest or the people had not pleased God in that sinfull Masse and oblation of theirs, I would
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:2645:106"/> easily haue beleeued him: but that the consecrated <hi>Host,</hi> which is according to the Romish Church very Christ, God and Man, should in any respect be said to be brought out of the fauour of God, or vnacceptable by any fault of ours, is an intollerable position, and full of heinouss iniurie to God and his sonne Christ. But there is good hope notwithstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding. For though they bring Christ out of his Fathers fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour, they will by praiers bring him in againe.

                     </head>
                     <p>I Haue said before in the Tract of Mediation, that the effect and fruit of Mediation and Aduocation are all one, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the things themselues are sundry in their own kinde. What therefore hath beene spoken of Mediation may suffice for the matter of <hi>Aduocation.</hi> Yet notwithstanding because to expresse fully that Iesus Christ is all things to all men, and that of himselfe alone without any other hee is sufficient to our Saluation, the Scriptures, and (following the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures) the ancient Church hath giuen vnto him all Titles of Office; as <hi>Redeemer, Mediatour, Aduocate, Intercessour,</hi> and such other: I will also of the Title of Aduocation speake briefely.</p>
                     <p>In the great high Priesthood of the eternall Son of God there is nothing more comfortable, then that hee hauing vnited vs vnto God generally by the coniunction of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to the diuine nature: specially and effectually by giuing vs his Spirit to knit vs also vnto God; and hauing sacrificed himselfe on the Altar of the Crosse, in which wee finde full and perfect Redemption: yet moreouer hee now also euer liueth to make intercession for vs. The worke of Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hath graffed vs into his body: but this restlesse and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessant Aduocation doth continue vs in his body; who dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of our selues start out, and hourely fall away from grace, but he still helpeth our infirmities; being our spirituall <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, holding vp</hi>

                     <p>Now in the handling of this excellent Office, because the effects thereof are all one with the fruits of his Mediation, as
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:2645:109"/> I haue shewed; therfore I will touch only three points of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation. First, that his Office of Aduocation is proper vnto Christ, and can by none but by him be performed. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I will answere the Arguments vpon which they ground the intercession and Aduocation of Saints. Thirdly, I will shew, that the Romish Aduocation of Saints is inuented to the imitation of the old Heathen.</p>

                     <p>THe Scripture calling Christ an Aduocate, taketh the Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taphor from worldly tribunals, &amp; seates Iudiciall: where in respect of the ignorance and vnabilitie of the common sort, learned and well experienced men are appointed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend and pleade their causes. Into this temporall function of an Aduocate, as none can intrude themselues, but such as by the iudge (who hath power) are thereto ordained: so none may take vpon him to exercise this spirituall Aduocation, but such as are by sufficient authoritie appointed. But to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine an Aduocate in heauenly things, none hath power but God: and hee hath constituted his Sonne onely. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no other Aduocate but Christ.</p>
                     <p>It is worthy due and serious consideration, that the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture so often and almost euery where setteth out vnto vs the Commission and authoritie, by which Christ vndertooke his office.<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 5.5.</note>

                     <p>The first is the wisedome of flesh, and reason of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall man, so often condemned by the Holy Ghost in the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred volume.</p>
                     <p>The second is the authoritie of Scriptures, miserably wrested from the true and naturall sense, which is enforced contrarie to the minde of the holy Ghost, to speake what it speaketh not, and to proue what it doth not intend.</p>
                     <p>Of the first kinde, their <hi>Rabbi Alexander</hi> of <hi>Hales</hi> bringeth three Reasons.<note n="b" place="margin">Alex. Alens. ex Chemnic. de inuoc. Sanct.</note> First, our owne want, imperfection and weakenesse in our selues. Secondly, the glorifying and prai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of Saints, whose honour is thereby exalted, in that wee
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:2645:111"/> confesse them able to commend our prayers to God, and to obtaine graces for vs. Thirdly, the reuerence wee owe vnto God, being of our selues wretched sinners, and therefore cannot be bold to thrust our selues into the presence of our glorious God; And for this cause wee must make the Saints our Aduocates. To these three heads may bee well reduced all the Reasons taken from humane vnderstanding, which the Romane Church can alledge for their defence in this controuersie. Of the second sort of arguments taken from the Scripture, I will speake in their place. Now le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="3 letters">

                     <p>THe want and imperfection of our nature doth in three things especially vtter and declare it selfe. <hi>The first defect is of our righteousnesse in deseruing. Wherefore wee haue neede</hi> (say they) <hi>to borrow of the merits of Saints to supply our pouerty in desert.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>The second is our want and defect of knowledge in contemplation. For our eyes are as the eyes of an owle vnto the bright sunne beames, neither can we behold the vnaccessible light. Wherefore wee must commit our cause to the Saints, who doe behold him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>our want and imperfection in loue and deuotion, which should be the strength of our prayers. Therefore</hi> (they say) <hi>That Man being full of imperfection doth feele himselfe oftentimes to be more stirred vp in deuotion towards Saints, then towards God himselfe.</hi>

                     <p>TO the vnderstanding of the weakenesse of this shadow of reason, it is necessarie to discerne betwixt Man in himselfe, in his corruption, as hee is meerely naturall, full of sinnefull abominations, from the sole of the foote vnto the crowne of the head, nothing but boiles and botches; And Man in his Christ, in his regeneration and new birth, being washed and sanctified in the bloud of Christ. When we come then to God in our inuocation and prayer, though wee be in nature sinners and loathsome Lepers, both to our selues, and to all that looke on vs: yet we pray in the Name of Christ, the true salt of euery sacrifice, and wee put on,<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 27.15.</note> like <hi>Iacob,</hi> our elder brothers garments, to obtaine the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing, wherein wee are cleane and holy, and for such are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted in the sight of God.<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 9.31.</note>
                        <hi>We know</hi> (saith the blind man in the Gospell) <hi>that God heareth not sinners.</hi> Wherefore that God should heare our prayers, it is necessary that wee be not sinners but righteous: and such wee are onely in the bloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shedding of Iesus Christ, and by his sanctification. Indeede I must confesse, it is Pharisaicall pride, to say,<note place="margin">Luke 18.</note> we are holy in our selues, or righteous in our selues: and so it is also despe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to deny our selues to be holy in Christ; and that in
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:2645:112"/> Christ we are not worthy to haue any accesse vnto God. We haue in Christ a treasure of merits, a full satisfaction to offer vnto the Father. His deseruings are a superabundant recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for all our transgressions and debts: a superabundant paiment for all our purchase. God doth require nothing at Mans hand, which Christ is not vnto God for Man. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there can be no want of merit in them, who, when they come vnto God, come in CHRIST IESVS, and offer vp their prayers seasoned in the bloud, and sweetened with the perfume of the Tabernacle, which maketh the flesh, euen of beasts and of birds, acceptable sacrifices, and the prayers of sinners welcome oblations vnto God; especial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, seeing Iesus Christ prayeth for vs, as our Priest, and our Sacrifice: prayeth in vs, as our head: and is prayed vnto of vs as our Aduocate.</p>

                     <p>THe second cause which the first reason pretendeth, why we should seeke helpe of Saints, is the defect of contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation. Wee are so ignorant, that Man knoweth not him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, nor his owne soule within him: how should hee then know the things that are without him, the diuers wants both for this and the better life? It may therefore seeme, that these blinde eyes haue neede of better directours then themselues, euen the Saints, who in the face of him that vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holdeth all things, doe all things know, say they.</p>
                     <p>To this Sophistication wee may truely answere; that, as Christ is our righteousnesse, so he is also our wisedome, by whom we know so much of God, as is sufficient to be known to eternall life. For he hath taught vs, who it is, that must be prayed vnto: by whom he must bee prayed vnto: for what we must pray vnto him: and after what sort we must pray vn- him. And these are the foure parts necessarie vnto prayer; which being obserued, euery prayer is acceptable. For this

                     <p>TO speake of the third reason of the first argument, which is, the want of loue in vs, and that vnperfect Man is often more moued in deuotion towards Saints then toward God, there is no neede. For it is of all fantasticall conceits the most idle. Who knoweth not that wee are bound<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 6.5.</note>
                        <hi>to loue God with all our heart, with all our soule, with all our strength?</hi> This loue if at any time we finde to waxe cold in our selues, wee must not therefore runne to Saints, and to departed soules of holy men with our deuotion; but, by all the meanes we can, stirre vp our loue, towards God, and strengthen the weake things, that are ready to die. <hi>Origen</hi> well obserueth, that there are two sweet and gratefull names in Christ, which doe allure men vnto him; God calleth him his <hi>Welbeloued Sonne.</hi> These appellations (saith hee) are so printed in our senses, that euen the communitie of the names ioineth vs to the societie of the gifts. Appellations of such sweetnesse mol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lifie our hearts, and kindle in vs the affection of deuotion.

The proposition therefore it selfe, That infirme Man is more affected in religion toward Saints, then to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, is very vntrue.

                        <hi>BEllarmine,</hi> and his Master <hi>Eckius</hi> before him will needs proue the inuocation of Saints out of Scripture. To which purpose they alledge the fortie eight of <hi>Genesis;</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 48.16</note>
                        <hi>The Angell which hath deliuered mee from all euill, blesse the children, and let my name bee named vpon them, and the name of my fathers</hi> Abraham <hi>and</hi> Isaack.</p>
                     <p>To the answering hereof wee must vnderstand, that the word Angell hath a double signification; somtime it is taken for a<note n="*" place="margin">Psa 103.20. &amp; Heb. 1.7</note> Ministring spirit; somtime for Iesus Christ himselfe: and so Christ is called<note n="b" place="margin">Esay 63.9.</note> the Angell, that went foorth from his presence. Now <hi>Iacob</hi> here praieth not to the other com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Angells, but to the great Angell of office, Iesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>Three places they bring out of <hi>Iob.</hi> The first, out of the fift Chapter;<note n="c" place="margin">Iob 5.2</note>
                        <hi>Call now, if any will answer, and to which of the Saints will thou turne? Ergo,</hi> there is inuocation of Saints. The very words, which went before, shew the meaning of <hi>Elyphas</hi> to bee, <hi>That God is onely righteous, and all men sinners: God only et<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>rnall: Man,</hi> yea the Saints themselues, transi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torie; which hauing finished their course, rest with God and cease from humane things, neither can giue helpe to any. Wherefore call (saith hee) <hi>If any will heare thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turne?</hi> Surely <hi>Elyphas</hi> yieldeth as litle
<pb n="176" facs="tcp:2645:115"/> helpe to the Church of Rome in the questiō, as he did cōfort to <hi>Iob</hi> in his miserie. But admit these words of <hi>Elyphas</hi> were to their aduantage; yet what foundation can bee layd vpon the speeches of such an one, of whome the Lord himselfe hath pronounced,<note n="d" place="margin">Iob 42.7</note>
                        <hi>My wrath is kindled against thee, and thy two friends: For yee haue not spoken of mee the thing which is right, like my seruant Iob.</hi> Againe, the verie contexture of the place alleadged doth altogether proue the contrarie.<note n="e" place="margin">Iob. 4</note> For <hi>Elyphas</hi> was striken into terrour: his bones trembled in him: his hayre also stood vpright: and a winde passed by, and one stoode before him like an Image, whome hee knew not. All which circumstances teach, that this was a vision, and the doctrine thereof was this; that God found sinne in his Angells, much more in men, which dwell in houses of clay, who perish for euer without returne: so that if you call to them, they will not answer. Wherefore wee must enquire of God, and turne our talke vnto him.</p>
                     <p>The other place in the ninth of <hi>Iob,</hi> where the patient man saith,<note n="f" place="margin">Iob 19.22</note> (<hi>Miseremini mei, amici;</hi> haue mercy on me my friends: the common latine translation, which they so much approue, sheweth that <hi>Iob</hi> in the complaints of that Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was a type of Christ, and his great afflictions. Which if it bee so, I hope, they will not say, that <hi>Iob</hi> being typicall Christ did praie for the help of Angells: but if the words bee literally taken, they euidently require the true and faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full compassion of his friends, that stoode by; who in stead of a louing visitation did vnkindly vpbraid him, and vex him with taunts and bitter reproofes. As for that place in the thirty thirde of <hi>Iob;</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Iob 33.23</note>
                        <hi>si fuerit pro eo Angelus loquens,</hi> if an Angell shall speake for him; the text is corrupted. For the <hi>Hebrew</hi> soundeth thus; if an Angell or Messenger speake to him: and not for him.</p>
                     <p>Lastlie they vrge the place of the thirtie two of <hi>Exodus,</hi> where <hi>Moses</hi> saith,<note n="h" place="margin">Exod. 32.13</note>
                        <hi>Remember Abraham, Isaack</hi> &amp; <hi>Israel thy seruants, to whome thou swarest by thy owne selfe.</hi> But (as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore sayd) this place is no proofe of praier vnto Saints; for that, by <hi>Bellarmins</hi> owne confession, before the comming
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:2645:115"/> of Christ the Soules of holy men departed were not in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen. Therefore they could not bee prayed vnto, because they could not praie for vs, who did not thē in the face of Chr. (as they say) behould our wants. This place then doth set Gods owne Couenant, which was his mere mercy, before the eyes of God, as a motiue sufficient to implore forgiueness of sins and continuation of his grace. The same is to bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of that place,<note n="i" place="margin">Psa. 132.10</note>
                        <hi>For thy seruant Dauids sake turne not away the presence of thine anointed. Dauid</hi> was the type of Christ: and many times by the name of <hi>Dauid,</hi> Christ is vnderstood. As for <hi>Aaron</hi> standing betwixt the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing and the dead with his censer, it was a figure of Christ also, and praieth him to bee our only Aduocate.</p>
                     <p>Of all vanities, that of <hi>Eckius</hi> doth excell, who saith, Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God doth honour his,<note place="margin">Ioh. 13</note> and Christ did minister to his <hi>Disciples, therefore wee muct pray vnto Saints, and honour them in our religious worship:</hi> as though Christ washing his Apostles feet did adore his Apostles: or the honour of reward, which god giueth to his chosen, were a sufficient argument, that the honour of adoration &amp; inuocation may bee giuen to them.</p>

                     <p>The same estimation is to be made of the decretal Epistles, which they pretend to haue beene written by the Primitiue Bishoppes of Rome.

For euery authour must not be reckoned among the Fathers; but such only as liued neare the time of the
<pb n="181" facs="tcp:2645:117"/> Apostles, or in the Primitiue Curch. For then the Church (as <hi>Eusebius</hi> well obserueth) was a virgin. Wherefore, as one<note n="p" place="margin">Plut. in vita eius.</note> said of <hi>Philopemen,</hi> that he was the last of all the <hi>Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians:</hi> so may wee say, that the age of the Fathers ended al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most with Saint <hi>Austin;</hi> as that learned man <hi>Bartholomeus Keckermannus</hi> truly obserueth.</p>
                     <p>By this rule then, the testimonies of <hi>Bernard, Gregorie Beda, Damascen, Theophylact, Anselme,</hi> and diuers others, whome the Romish Church hath put into the Albe of the Fathers, is to bee iudged and examined by the reasons and arguments they bring, not by the authoritie and celebrity of their names; since they liued long after the tyme of the Churches puritie, in corrupt and superstitious ages.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, it is specially to bee obserued, that wee iudge not <label type="milestone">

For it were most absurd to iudge the generall by the speciall, all the doctrine of a man by one sentence, or all the Fathers by one Father.

And so all the rest are but the seue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall powers of one and the same God. Heerein the Romish Church doth nothing differ from the Idolatours. For as they acknowledge one onely true and immortall God, so did the Heathens also confesse the same.</p>
                     <p>The beginning of the Heathenish, and the Popish Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try was much after the same fashion. For the Heathens put their excellent Kings, and the inuentours of workes benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall to mankinde, yea, sometimes their Friends and their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents into the Albe of their Gods; as <hi>Ninus</hi> did <hi>Belus,</hi> and <hi>Aeneas Anchises;</hi> as <hi>Tully</hi> in the second booke <hi>de natura De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orum,</hi> and <hi>Pliny</hi> in the worlds historie, and <hi>Ʋirgil</hi> in his <hi>Aeneidos</hi> teach. Yet these they neuer held equall to the God of Nature, but put alwaies a difference betwixt their mortall &amp; immorral powers; the Gods that were made, &amp; the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous maiesty of the eternal vncreated Deity. Wherfore they are tearmed <hi>Heroes</hi> &amp; <hi>Semi-dei,</hi> half Gods, &amp; worthies, whose vertues and noble acts men sung at great feasts and solemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to honour their memories with Hymnes of praise, and to stir vp others to follow their example.</p>
                     <p>The same is the progresse of the Christian Idolatry. At the first the memories of Saints were solemnized onely to excite men to follow their vertues; as the Epistle of the Church of <hi>Smyrna</hi> to the <hi>Philomelians</hi> touching the buriall of <hi>Polycarpus</hi> doth witnesse. Wherein they plainely professe the honour
<pb n="184" facs="tcp:2645:119"/> of Martyrs to be no other, but that the minds of Men should bee prouoked by notable examples, vnto the waies of their predecessours.

                     <p>Consider againe, I pray you, that as the Heathens of their <hi>Heroes</hi> erected Images, before which they worshipped: so the Romanists haue of their Saints made the pictures, to whom they also doe seruice.</p>
                     <p>The Heathens kept the Reliques of their Gods, and gaue great worship vnto them; and the head of <hi>Orpheus</hi> in <hi>Lesbos,</hi> the Cradle of <hi>Iupiter</hi> in <hi>Crete,</hi> the Image of <hi>Diana</hi> at <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus,</hi> which was sent down from heauen, and a thousand such.

                     <p>Another agreement there is betwixt the Heathen and the Christian Saints in miracles. For the Pagans pleaded for their Gods, that they were workers of great wonders. <hi>Castor</hi> and <hi>Pollux</hi> in the Latine warre were seene washing their horses at the Lake <hi>Iuturna.</hi> And in the <hi>Macedonian</hi> warre,

So the <hi>Idean</hi> Mother, when the Ship, wherein she was brought toward Rome stucke fast in <hi>Tybur,</hi> to shew the chastitie of <hi>Claudia,</hi> whom for her ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much nicenesse in attiring her selfe the people tooke to be a strumpet, was content that the Ship should follow <hi>Claudia</hi> vp the Riuer towed by her Girdle onely. A myracle also they report of <hi>Esculapius,</hi> deliuering Rome from the pestilence: and how <hi>Appius Claudius</hi> was strooken blinde, when contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rie to the Oracle he had translated the holy Ceremonies of <hi>Hercules</hi> to the seruants in Rome: and how <hi>Fuluius</hi> the Censor was stroken with madnesse, because hee tooke the marble tables out of the Temple of <hi>Iuno,</hi> to couer the house of Fortune which he built: Much they speake of <hi>Turulius</hi> ouerthrowne in battaile, after hee had cut downe in <hi>Coos</hi> the wood of <hi>Esculapius</hi> to make Ships therewith. And what should I speake of <hi>Milesian Ceres?</hi> who strucke blinde with lightening the souldiers, which brake into her City to spoile the same.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. LXI.</hi> Of Iustification, the fourth effect of Christs great Priesthood.</head>
                     <p>IT is most true, that the marrow, or rather the spirit and life of Christian Religion is Iustification from sinne. And therfore, as there is no point, wherin the Euangelists &amp; Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and all carefull Teachers haue more laboured then in this: so there is no worke of the High Priest and Bishop of our soules more impugned by the Synagogue of Antichrist, then the pure reines and spotlesse righteousnesse of Christ, wherewith he hath clothed the nakednesse of his members, presenting them blamelesse and without spot to GOD. Wherefore here it is wonderfull to consider, what tempests and stormes: what clouds and darknesse: what mists of errours they interpose betwixt the bright Sunne of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ousnesse, and the poore distressed conscience or Man.</p>
                     <p>The Doctrine of the Scripture is plaine and simple, that<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 1.29.</note>

                        <hi>our peace, our life.</hi> By all which Emphaticall and powerful words, the Spirit of God denounceth vnto vs, that hee is all we want, and all wee neede vnto the purchase of the eternall inheritance. But the Romish Church hath so ouerwhelmed the whole work with questions and perplexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they haue hidden Christ from the wounded con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, &amp; with their intricate disputations robbed the soule of her peace, her Sabbath, her consolation.</p>
                     <p>To this purpose haue they hedged vp our way vvith thornes; multitudes (I meane) of distinctions, modifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, restrictions, reseruations, quirks and quiddities; The merite of congruitie, the merite of dignitie and condigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: the first iustification, the second iustification, the grace of iustification, and iustification it selfe: the merite of the worke, and the satisfaction of the worke: grace freely gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen, and grace making gracious: things in Scripture com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded,
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:2645:125"/> and things counselled: the merite of the worke, and the merite of the person: the cause, by which, and the cause, for which: simple debt, and the debt by Gods owne disposition: merite properly taken, and improperly taken: occasionall righteousnesse, and meritorious righteousnesse: righteousnesse commutatiue, and righteousnesse distribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiue: workes of necessitie, and workes of supererogation; and sundry more, which I might repeate. Of all which the onely end and purpose is, to take away from Christ the honour of our Iustification: to entangle the simple and ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant heart with nets, brakes Labyrinths of perplexitie, boiling, yea, drowning our Passeouer in water,<note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 12.</note> which should be roast with fire; that is, obscuring, through the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicitie of their difficult and intricate Riddles, the Doctrine of Saluation, which should be receiued onely with simpli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citie of faith. But because diuers excellent and famous wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses of the trueth, haue of this argument most learnedly and copiously disputed, I will onely set before thy eyes, Christian R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Secondly, the Romish corruption, wherewith they haue leauened this doctrine. Thirdly, the Limitations, with which they thinke it lawfull to deny the merits of CHRIST to be our full and sufficient iustification. Fourth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, I shall shew thee, that these their rules and Limitations are not obserued by themselues, neither in their priuate opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, nor publique worship. Which I will doe by the helpe of God, in the tractations of the seuerall Limitations.</p>

                     <p>MVch adoe there is made by many, concerning the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uers vnderstanding of the word Iustification; beeing taken sometime for the Law, which commandeth righteous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse: sometime for the obtaining of righteousnesse: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time for the increase of righteousnesse: and sometime for the
<pb n="198" facs="tcp:2645:126"/> iudiciall declaration of righteousnesse; as when the iudge pronounceth a man innocent, or not guiltie of the crime intended against him. The Latine phrase, <hi>Iustificare,</hi> indeede is as much, as to make righteous: but the Hebrew phrase doth import so much, as to pronounce one righteous. So it is taken in <hi>Deuterenomie;</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 25.1.</note>
                        <hi>The righteous shall be iustified, and the wicked condemned.</hi> In the same sense <hi>Iob</hi> vseth the word;<note n="b" place="margin">Iob 27.5.</note>

                        <hi>By his knowledge shall my righteous seruant iustifie many.</hi> The same is also the most common vnderstanding of the word in the New Testament.<note n="e" place="margin">Math. 11.19.</note>
                        <hi>Wisedome,</hi> saith our Sauiour) <hi>is iustified of her children.</hi> And in the seuenth of <hi>Luke;</hi>
                        <note n="f" place="margin">Luke 7.29.</note>
                        <hi>All the people that heard him and the Publicanes, being baptized with the bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisme of</hi> Iohn, <hi>iustified God.</hi> In the same sense also it is taken in the eighteenth of <hi>Luke,</hi> where of the humble Publicane he saith;<note n="g" place="margin">Luke 18.14.</note>
                        <hi>I tell you this man went home to his house iustified rather then the other.</hi> So that it is cleare, that in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture the most vsuall and frequent vnderstanding of the word <hi>Iustifie,</hi> is to absolue, acquite, or pronounce righteous.</p>
                     <p>Indeede, this of all matters that fall into consideration, is the most weighty; namely, to vnderstand what hauen of rest the poore distressed soule of man wearied with the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and affrighted with the tempests of sinne, and of des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration the companion of sinne, may haue to harbour it selfe quietly and securely in: what it shall lay hold on to defend it selfe, from the iust wrath and righteous displeasure of the most high:<note place="margin">Deut. 4.

Rob. Episc.

                     <p>The Synagogue of <hi>Rome</hi> hath for many yeares, like an vnskilfull Surgion, omitted the onely true and soueraigne
<pb n="199" facs="tcp:2645:126"/> balme of a wounded conscience, Iesus Christ; and with vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercifull cruelty terrified, and tortured the consciences of men, by obtruding vnto them worthlesse and vneffectuall salues of their owne proper satisfactions, of will worship, of supererogations, of the merits of Frierly orders, of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage of Saints, of Pilgrimage, of Pardons, and sundry such other. In which, a conscience loaden with sin, and bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten downe with the anger and wrath of God, can yet ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer get ease, nor comfort. And on the other side, they haue slandered the doctrine, which teacheth the conscience of man to rest and repose it selfe on the merits only of Christ, with many impious and blasphemous reproches; as though the reformed Churches did teach, that man obtained forgiue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of sinne by Christ, but no kinde of Sanctification, or renuing of the inward man, or grace of repentance by him; as though wee taught that Charitie, and newnesse of life did not follow remission of sinnes. Yea, they shame not to say, that we cast off all care of obedience to the Law of God, and all good workes; and that<note n="i" place="margin">Kellison l. <hi>3</hi> c. <hi>2</hi>

                        <hi>in teaching free iustificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by Christ, wee open the wide gappe to all vice, and loose the bridle to all iniquitie: that wee giue good leaue to all faithfull men to commit all sinne and wickednesse.</hi> But vnto all the world be it knowne, that the reformed Churches doe vehement<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly abhorre that heresie of <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> which fained, that men freely by grace saued may doe what they list, as beeing not tied to the obseruation of the holy lawes of God. And we condemne no lesse the abomination of <hi>Basilides,</hi> who taught, that vnto those that are saued by grace, all actions good or euill, cleane or vncleane, are indifferent.

Neither is it questioned, whether good workes bee requisite in all true beleeuers; or whether repentance, contrition, a purpose to amend, charitie, almes, fasting and prayer ought to bee ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly ensued by a Christian man? But the question is, what it is for which our GOD doth absolue and account inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent him that is nocent; and righteous, him that is sinfull? What it is that wicked man must oppose to Gods wrath, and wherewith hee must defend himselfe from the same? what faith must trust vnto: what it must insist vpon, when it will entreat with God concerning forgiuenesse of sinne and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life? what the meane i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Whether it be the satisfaction, the obedience and deseruing of Christ in his owne person? Or whether it be the actuall righteousnesse, which wee our selues standing in true faith, and being rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate, doe bring forth by the grace of the spirit of Christ? Now, to the discussing of this question, there is no better way, then leauing the quirks and subtilties of scholasticall Writers, to inquire first in what things the Scripture forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth vs to place our righteousnesse; and then, whereon the Scripture will haue vs relye, and settle our selues in this behalfe.</p>

                     <p>As before hee is conceiued, before hee is borne, before he is come to perfect iudgement, a regenerate man cannot merite: so after this life it is manifest, hee cannot deserue at Gods hand. For <hi>Ecclesiastes</hi> saith,<note n="g" place="margin">Eccles. 9.5</note>

                     <p>It remaineth lastlie to consider; whether the works of a regenerate man hauing all aduantagees that may bee (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing done out of iudgement, and by the aduice of reason, by a man of mature yeares, through a liuely faith) can iustifie the doers?

                     <p>The first reason therefore that Man cannot iustifie him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe, is taken from our condition, who are not our owne men; but all that we are, we are the Lords: hee hath a three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fould iurisdiction, ouer vs. The First, as a Father ouer his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren; because he is our Creator, vve are in his hand as clay in the hand of the Potter:<note n="k" place="margin">Psa. 100.2</note>

                        <hi>CHAP. LXV.</hi> Wherein the Scripture of God hath placed our righteousnesse, and what it is that sinfull Man may oppose against Gods wrath and iust displeasure.</head>
                     <p>SVssiciently I haue discoursed, I trust, in what things our iustification is not placed. By which the Pharisaicall pride of workes is altogether beaten downe. Our next disquisiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on must be, wherein the Scripture of God hath placed our righteousnesse, and what it is, that sinfull Man may oppose against Gods wrath and iust displeasure. And surely nothing can be more reasonable, then to beleeue, that the bloud and merits of Christ (in which wee are washed from sinne: by which we haue performed the Law) are the meanes also, by which in the sight of God we are accounted innocent. For what is innocencie, but cleanenesse from sinne? And what hath made vs cleane from sinne, but the bloud of Christ? What can purchase the infinite inheritance of glorie, but infinite righteousnesse proportionable thereto? And what obedience, or righteousnesse is infinite according to the infinitie of the glorie, and proportionable to the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of the reward, but onely that which Christ hath done for vs?</p>
                     <p>Here appeareth the diuersitie betwixt the Law and the Gospell. For in the Law one cannot satisfie for another, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is one man innocent for another mans righteousnesse; euen as the Psalmist saith;<note n="a" place="margin">Psal. 49 7.</note>

                     <p>Merit they make of three sorts: merit of congruity, dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, and condignity. Merit of congruity or fitnesse, is it, by which a man is disposed, and prepared to receiue grace ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Gods righteousnes. And thus euen vnregenerate men merit the first grace. For, Man doing what he can, it is meet, reasonable, and fit, that God should remunerate and reward him: but this merit of congruitie doth not attaine vnto eternall life, it deserueth not saluation, they say. The second degree of merit, is merit of dignity: which is the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of him that worketh, to attaine that which hee doth deserue: that is, when a man doth deserue being regenerate, and standing in the state of grace; Here is a fitnesse to bee re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded in the person of the worker, by reason of the Holie Ghost, which moueth him. The third is the merit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignity: which presupposeth an equality<note n="m" place="margin">Vid. Comp. Theo. verit. lib. <hi>5</hi> cap. <hi>11.</hi>

                     <p>BEcause simply to place Iustification in humane workes is spirituall pride, and the intolerable tumor of Pharisaicall arrogancy; therefore the Babylonish strumpet hath mixt her cup of Venome vvith a little Wine to colour it, and hath put Tryacle in the poison, thinking with a few distinctions and Limitations, to make her false coyne currant, and her diue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Positions, true Diuinitie. The first is, They doe not attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this power of Iustification to the vvorkes of vnregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men, but to such workes as are done by the faithfull, through the mouing of the Spirit of Christ. Therefore see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the works vvhich iustifie, are done by the grace of Christ, it is still Christ that iustifieth, and Christ that meriteth in vs. For this cause the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> saith,<note n="a" place="margin">Nisi in Christo renascerentur nun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quā iustificarentur, cum ea renascentia, per meritū passion<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>Free will without the grace of the Spirit of God cannot bring forth good workes.</hi> Which is not, because free wil in man hath no power before conuersion to bring forth good and spirituall workes; but because the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turall powers are so vvrapped and bound with the chaines of sinne, that a man by his owne power cannot deliuer himselfe. As a man chained therefore in fetters wanteth no faculty or power to goe, but is onely hindred by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment vpon him: so (saith he) is the will of an vnrege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate man.</p>
                     <p>You see in what sense the Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> pronounceth them accursed, which say, that a man vvithout preuenting grace cannot beleeue, nor repent: that is, he can beleeue and repent by the force of the naturall powers: but hee cannot
<pb n="226" facs="tcp:2645:140"/> beleeue nor repent, by reason of the impediment hanging on him. And that <hi>Andradius</hi> doth truly expound their meaning, they themselues giue apparant testimonie in the seuenth Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non of the sixt Session: in which they accurse him, who shall say, <hi>that all workes before iustification, what way soeuer wrought, are sinne.</hi> Doth not the taile now bewray the Fox, and his eares the Woolfe? For, if any vnregenerate man can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not prepare himselfe to grace (as they teach in the second Canon) vvhy is hee excommunicate in the seuenth Canon, vvho doth say; that the workes of the vnregenerate are sinne? The whole streame of Scholasticall doctrine is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to this point, that a man vnregenerate by his pure na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turalitie may eschew and auoid all sinne: and so, doing what in him is, out of Congruitie may deserue the grace of God. <hi>Iohn de Combis,</hi> in the <hi>Compendium</hi> of <hi>Theological</hi> verity saith,<note n="c" place="margin">Comp.

                        <hi>CHAP. LXXIV.</hi> Of the sundry significations of the word Sanctification.</head>
                     <p>THat it may bee the better vnderstood,<note place="margin">Sanctification the fift worke of Christs priestly office.</note> what kinde of Sanctification it is which we are now to entreat of, it is fit to consider the sundry significations of the word, which are found in the holy Scripture.</p>
                     <p>To sanctifie therefore, is as much as to dedicate, or to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate vnto holy vses, or to esteeme religious vnto God; &amp; this vnderstanding the word hath in diuers places. <hi>Moses</hi> saith;<note n="a" place="margin">Deut 5.12.</note>
                        <hi>Keepe the Sabbath day, to sanctifie it.</hi> And the Lord commandeth;<note n="b" place="margin">Exod. 13.2</note>
                        <hi>Sanctifie vnto me all the first borne.</hi> After this sense<note n="c" place="margin">Exod. 40.9.10</note> the tabernacle and all the instruments are <hi>sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied,</hi> that is, by solemne rites and due ceremons dedicated vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to God.</p>
                     <p>To sanctifie, is otherwhile taken for to bee stirred vp to execute the wrath of God. In this sense <hi>Moses</hi> biddeth the <hi>Leuites;</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 32.29▪</note>
                        <hi>Consecrate your hands,</hi> when of the Idolatrous people they slew three thousand. Yea, the Lord himselfe sai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth of the wicked <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persians,</hi> that he had sanctified them to the destruction of <hi>Babylon:</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Esay 13.3.</note>
                        <hi>I haue commanded them, that I haue sanctified: and I haue called the mighty to my wrath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To sanctifie, is also as much as to praise God, and to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour him, either in priuate or in publike worship. And thus the word is taken in that holy praier which Christ commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to his Church, in which we are taught to say,<note n="*" place="margin">Mat. 6.9</note>
                        <hi>Hallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed be thy name.</hi> Heereof <hi>Saint Peter</hi> speaketh;<note n="f" place="margin">1 Pet. 3, 15</note>
                        <hi>Sanctifie the Lord God in your hearts.</hi> And in this sense God reproueth <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Deut. 32.51.</note>
                        <hi>Ye sanctified not mee among the children of Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To sanctifie, doth also signifie as much as to make a thing seeme holy. So it is to bee taken in that saying of our Saui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our;<note n="h" place="margin">Mat. 23.17 <hi>Ibid.</hi> ver. 19.</note>
                        <hi>Yee fooles and blinde, whether is greater the golde, or the temple that sanctifieth the gold? yee fooles and blinde, whether is greater the offering, or the altar which sanctifieth the offering?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <pb n="252" facs="tcp:2645:155"/>
                     <p>Lastly, to Sanctifie, is to cleanse the conscience from the dead workes of sinne,<note place="margin">Luke 1.75. 1. Pet. 1.15.</note> to serue the Lord in righteousnesse and holinesse. And this is the Sanctification we are to speak of now. This consisteth in two things: First, in abstaining from all corruption of sinne and wickednesse, whereof <hi>Iere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie</hi> speaketh;<note n="i" place="margin">Ier. 4.4.</note>
                        <hi>Breake vp your fallow ground, and sow not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the thornes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The second part of Sanctification consisteth in beautifying our conuersation with vertues and holy workes, which God hath ordained vs to walke in. This, <hi>Iob</hi> as a figure of Christ attributeth to himselfe;<note n="k" place="margin">Iob 19.14.</note>
                        <hi>I put on iustice, and it couered me: my iudgement was as a robe, and a crowne.</hi> Thus the Apostle would haue his <hi>Ephesians</hi> to be adorned;<note n="l" place="margin">Ephes. 6.14.15</note>
                        <hi>Stand therefore hauing your loynes girt about with verity, and hauing on the brest-plate of righteousnesse, and your feete shod in the preparation of the Gospell of Peace.</hi>

                        <hi>CHAP. LXXV.</hi> That Sanctification of life is necessarie to a Christian man.</head>
                     <p>ALthough the Christian faith doth not admit of Iustifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before God by our owne merits, and our owne ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse, euen where such workes and holinesse doe proceede from the grace of Christ in vs: yet, that vnto euery member of Christ holinesse and good workes are requisite, the true Religion doth vndoubtedly affirme and teach; and thereof are many Reasons.</p>
                     <p>First, because it is one of the ends, for which he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed vs: For so the Apostle witnesseth;<note n="a" place="margin">Ephes. 1.4.</note>
                        <hi>He hath cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen vs in him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy, and without blame before him in loue.</hi> And to the <hi>Colossians;</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Col. 1.21.22.</note>
                        <hi>You which were in times past strangers and enimies, because your mindes were set in euill workes, hath hee now also reconciled in the body of his flesh through death, to make you holy and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blameable, and without fault in his sight.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, because we are commanded by God to walke before him in<note n="c" place="margin">1. P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>t. 1.15.16 Luke 1.75.</note> righteousnesse and holinesse. Wherefore vnto the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> the Apostle witnesseth;<note n="d" place="margin">1. Thes 4.3.</note>
                        <hi>This is the
<pb n="253" facs="tcp:2645:155"/> will of God, euen your Sanctification.</hi> And the Lord himselfe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireth of the children of <hi>Israel;</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Leuit. 19.2.</note>
                        <hi>Yee shall bee holy, for I the Lord your God am holy.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third cause, why sanctitie and holinesse is necessarie to a Christian man, is, that God may bee glorified. So our Sauiour himselfe doth teach;<note n="f" place="margin">Math. 5.16.</note>
                        <hi>Let your light so shine before men, that they may see your good workes, and glorifie your Father, which is in heauen.</hi> This, Saint <hi>Peter</hi> also sheweth<note n="g" place="margin">1. Pet. 2.12.</note>
                        <hi>Haue your conuersation honest among the Gentiles, that they which speake euill of you as euill doers, may by your good workes which they shall see, glorifie God in the day of the visitation.</hi> A Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stian man therefore, if he neglect this dutie, may dread to haue the vvrath of GOD laid vpon him, as it vvas vpon <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron;</hi> whom God punished vvith temporall death, because they<note n="h" place="margin">Deut. 32.51.</note> did not sanctifie the Lord among the children of <hi>Israel.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, holinesse of life is necessarie to a Christian man, that by our example the weake Brethren may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed. Hereof <hi>Peter</hi> speaketh in his exhortation to married women;<note n="i" place="margin">1. Pet. 3.1.</note>
                        <hi>Let the wiues be subiect to their husbands, that euen they which obey not the word, may without the word bee wonne by the conuersation of the wiues.</hi> This is it, which the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> meaneth, when he exhorteth <hi>Titus</hi>
                        <note n="k" place="margin">Tit. 2.7.</note>
                        <hi>to shew himselfe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample of good workes.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, holinesse of life is needfull vnto the seruants of God, that the mouthes of the obstinate may bee stopt. So the Apostle counselleth his <hi>Thessalonians, to</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">1. Thes. 4.12.</note>
                        <hi>behaue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues honestly towards them which are without.</hi> Thus <hi>Peter</hi> also exhorteth the elect, to<note n="m" place="margin">1. Pet. 3.13.16.</note>
                        <hi>Sanctifie the Lord in their hearts, and to bee ready alwaies to giue an answere to euery man, that as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth a reason of the hope that is in them: and that with meekenes and reuerence, hauing a good conscience, that when they speake euill of you as euill doers, they may be ashamed, which blame your good conuersation in Christ.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixtly, to all the members of the church of Christ holines is needfull, that one may helpe another, &amp; one by another may be relieued. For God hath so compacted the mysticall bodie

                        <hi>Blessed is he that iudgeth wisely of the cause of the poore, the Lord shall deliuer him in the time of trouble.</hi> And our Sauiour saith;<note n="o" place="margin">Luke 11.41.</note>

                     <p>THe meanes, by which God doth Sanctifie his elect, are of two sorts. The First, outward and instrumentall: the Second, inward and effectiue; namely the sweet influence and gratious working of the spirit of God in our hearts. Of the first sort there are two kinds; <hi>Common,</hi> and <hi>Consecrated. Common</hi> meanes of Sanctification are all Gods blessings, and all his punishments, his benefits, and his chastisements, by which God deterreth from sinne, and allureth to holiness. For although the wicked by these growe daily worse and worse: yet the elect, and the children of light are by these Sanctified, that is, stirred vp to holiness. For when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the blessings of God poured vpon them, they say with <hi>Dauid;</hi>

                     <p>THe law which God giueth vnto Man, is of two sorts;<note n="a" place="margin">Vid. Ambr. in ep. ad Ro. cap. <hi>5.</hi>
                        </note> the lawe of <hi>Nature,</hi> and the lawe <hi>Written.</hi> The law of nature hath three parts. The first is, to acknowledge God, and to honour him only with that honour, which is due to him: The second is,<note n="b" place="margin">Vid. Sedulan <hi>5.</hi> ad Ro.</note> to order our selues according to the true light of reason, the rule of Nature in vs; which is to doe vnto euery man, as wee our selues would bee done vnto: The third is, to instruct others to know the same God, and to imbrace the same vertue, which wee embrace. But the naturall corruption, which wee haue drawne from <hi>Adam,</hi> hath so preuailed against this naturall instinct, which is shed into our hearts by God, that both reason is mis-led with errour, and our will by concupiscence; so that this lawe is in a maner defaced, and blotted out of our hearts. It was necessarie therefore, that God should, instead of this secret inspiration into our nature, promulge a more for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible instruction, and deliuer more powerfull commands in written tables; to take away all excuse, that the soule might be subiected wholly vnto God, the vnderstanding of Man being reformed by true beliefe, and the will of Man by true loue and charitie. This hath our mercifull God twice done vnto the sonnes of <hi>Adam,</hi> whose voice first shooke the earth, and<note n="c" place="margin">Hag 27.

<pb n="262" facs="tcp:2645:160"/> earth, but also the heauen.</hi> The first voice was the Law giuen vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Israel:</hi> The second, the Gospel preached vnto the Church.</p>
                     <p>
                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> The Law written consisted of three parts. The <hi>Ceremoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all</hi> law, for outward comelinesse, by which also the people <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> of God were discerned from other Nations: The second was, the Iudiciall part, in which were statutes for Ciuill go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement, whereby God taught his people how one should bee conformable to another, that there might be an harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> of all parts of their Politicall state: The third part of the Law doth consist in Morall precepts, to Sanctifie euery mans heart in himselfe preparing it to God.</p>
                     <p>The Law declared fully, what the inflexible and spotlesse righteousnesse of God required in vs, as necessarie vnto true holinesse. It was giuen<note n="d" place="margin">Exod. 19.16</note>
                        <hi>in lightning, in thunder, in a cloud, in fire, in smoke, the Mountaine trembling, and the trumpet soun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding dreadfully: yea, the People were commanded to Sanctifie themselues, and to wash their cloathes before they did receiue the Law:</hi> yet being Sanctified, and being cleansed,<note n="e" place="margin">Exod. 19.12.</note>
                        <hi>not to goe vp into the Mountaine, nor to touch it, least they died.</hi> All these cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances of glory and Maiestie were vsed, to driue on the people to the keeping of the Law by feare and terrour, seeing God shewed himselfe a consuming fire, a iealous God, and of vnspeakeable power: yea, the<note n="f" place="margin">Deut. 28.</note> law it selfe was crowned with many <hi>Blessings,</hi> to reward the good; and armed with many terrible <hi>Curses</hi> and execrations against those which should violate the same.</p>
                     <p>Here yet we must learne first, that because<note n="g" place="margin">Deut 4 8.</note> the law was giuen onely to one Nation, and not to all people: Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, because<note n="h" place="margin">Gal. 3.</note>
                        <hi>the Law onely shewed what was requisite to be done,</hi> but did not shew how that, which was wanting, should be supplied: Thirdly, because in the strict commandement of the Law there was no place for reparation by repentance, but<note n="i" place="margin">Ezek. 18.24.</note>
                        <hi>in the sinne he committed euery one must die:</hi> Fourthly, because the Law did conniue and winke at some things, which were not good, for<note n="k" place="margin">Math. 19.8. Marke 10.5.</note>
                        <hi>the hardnes of the hearts of men:</hi> Fiftly, for that it did obscurely and darkely rather intimate, then open the things of saluation, so<note n="l" place="margin">Heb. 9.9.</note>

                        <hi>The commandement, which I giue thee this day, is not hid from thee, neither is it farre off thee, neither is it too high in heauen, nor too farre beyond the Sea,</hi> that is, it is not dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult, it is not ambiguous:<note n="u" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 14.</note>
                        <hi>but the word is very neere to thee, in thy month and in thy heart to doe it.</hi> All these excellent Attributes, of truth, righteousnesse, life, eternitie, perfection, power, light, ioy, puritie, facilitie, shew that there is no word like this word, nor by which we may bee sanctified, as by the holy Oracles of our God.</p>
                     <p>Two Cautions there are in this matter to bee obserued. First, when wee say the Scripture doth sanctifie, it is not meant, that the Scripture is a satisfaction for sinne, or that it doth blot out our sinnes from the sight of God, as the bloud of Christ doth: but wee are sanctified by the word, that is, such as are redeemed by the bloud of Christ from sinne and wickednesse, haue the word of God a powerfull instrument to teach them true holinesse, and to beget in them hatred of sinne. Wherfore it is called the<note n="w" place="margin">Math. 13. Luke 8. 1. Pet. 1.23.</note> Seed of God. And <hi>Peter</hi> saith, that we are <hi>borne anew not of mortall seede, but of immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall by the word of God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, the force of Scripture doth not consist in the written letters and syllables, or in the verball pronunciation onely: but (as <hi>Peter</hi> saith,<note n="x" place="margin">1. Pet. 1.22.</note>
                        <hi>Your soules are purified in obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the truth through the Spirit.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now to make the word powerfull to saluation, it is not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, that it be written in bookes, or pronounced vvith tongues:<note n="y" place="margin">Ier. 31.33. Rom. 11.27. Heb. 10.16.</note>

                        <hi>CHAP. LXXXI.</hi> How the Church of Rome hath abused the doctrine of Sanctificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the word of God.</head>
                     <p>WHereas all that rightly beleeue, doe acknowledge the holy Scripture of God to cleanse and sanctifie the soule by the operation of the Spirit, preparing our minds to receiue and obey the same in sincerity and singlenesse of heart; the Romish Church putteth the force of Scriptures in the outward letter, and the bare sound of words. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they not onely read the Scripture in an vnknowne tongue, which many times the Priests themselues doe not vnderstand: but also they sometime enioyne for penance, sometime reward with blessings, the often saying ouer of the <hi>Aue Mari,</hi> and <hi>Pater noster,</hi> in the Latine tongue by igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant people; as though the often repeating of the words, which they vnderstand not, did sanctifie them, or were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable in the sight of God.</p>
                     <p>In the preface before the Psalter of Iesus, much doth the author thereof attribute vnto it, for that the name of Iesus is repeated, and called on foure hundred and fiftie times: And the Psalter it selfe must be sayd ouer tenne times toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. I confesse, they trouble not the people with much Scripture in their Missalls, but spend the time in exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons out of Fathers, or narrations of some Legend Histories, whose credite is vncertaine: But touching those short sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of Scripture, which in an vnknowne language are propounded, they say;<note n="a" place="margin">
                           <p>Per tuangelica dicta, delcantur nostra delicta. Ro. Breu. in Benedict. d cendis ante lecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ones. &amp;c.</p>

                        <hi>By the Euangelicall words let our sinnes bee abolished.</hi> Of which words I would willingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a true and simple interpretation of any ingenuous Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manist, in whom there is some sparke of pudency left. If they say, sinne is blotted out, that is, cleansed and washed away, and hidden from the sight of God by the words of the Scripture; then they robbe the bloud of Christ of the office which is assigned vnto it. For the Scripture is not the clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing of our sinnes, but the witnes and ioyfull tydings vnto vs
<pb n="269" facs="tcp:2645:163"/> from God, that our sinnes are cleansed: Secondly, if they say, that the Scripture cleanseth sinne, because it is an instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to sanctifie the heart, and to arme and strengthen it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne: then I reply, why doe you read it in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue, which the people vnderstand not? Either therefore the sound of the words, and the pronouncing of the Syllables doth sanctifie; or els your labour is in vaine and friuolous, since the people vnderstand not the sense, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther are partakers of the vertue and power of the word.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, that in the outward letter, the number of syllables, and in the verball repetition, they place the power of the word; as it may appeare in their doctrine, touching the administration of their Sacrament of Confession, which if it bee by writing, and not by speaking: or if a man send his confession by another to the Priest, who cannot come himselfe, this is no confession; insomuch, that (if a Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Historian truly relate) when a Iesuite published at <hi>Rome,</hi> that confession by Letters, was Sacramentall: <hi>Clement</hi> the 8.<note place="margin">Ex Pseudo mart. cap. <hi>4.</hi>
                        </note> by a direct decree condemned that doctrine as false, rash, and scandalous at least. At the consecration of the <hi>Hoste</hi> (as they tearme it) their doctrine is, that if euery tittle and letter of the words, <hi>Hoc est corpus meum,</hi> bee not pronounced, there is no due consecration, neither yet is there transubstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.<note n="b" place="margin">Cuius tota virtus de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>MAny things concerning the Rites and Sacraments of the Church are to be considered, that we may come or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly to our purpose, which is to shew the prophanation of the Sacraments in the Romish Church. We must therefore wel vnderstand in whome is the power and authority to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitute Sacraments: Secondly, what was the cause, and the end, for which they were ordained: Thirdly, what the vse of them is: Fourthly, what their worthinesse is, and wherin it consisteth: Fiftly, the difference betwixt the Sacraments of the old Couenant, and of the new must be considered.</p>
                     <p>The authority, by which Sacraments are ordained, is only in God himselfe, and in none other. Christ hath giuen power to his Ministers to distribute and dispense them vnto his Church; but not to ordaine new Sacraments, or other Sacraments, then such as he himselfe hath left vnto vs. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of are sundry reasons. The first shall be taken from the word it selfe.</p>
                     <p>The children of Israell were commanded<note n="a" place="margin">Deut. 4.2.</note> not to adde vnto the precept which the Lord spake, nor to take from it, but to keepe the Commandements of the Lord their God, which he commanded them: Neither were they only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to keepe the doctrine, which he gaue them, inuio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lably, without addition or diminution, but the Rites also and Ceremonies.

                        <hi>I haue receiued of the Lord that which I also haue deliuered vnto you.</hi> And of other doctrines, which are not receiued of the Lord, hee sayth:<note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 1.8.</note>

                     <p>If earthly things consecrated and separated to holy vse, could haue yielded such benefite to mankinde, Christ nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded not with the lamentable profusion, and deare expence of his sacred bloud to haue redeemed vs. The Ceremonies of the Law vvere instituted by GOD himselfe, and deliuered with great glory, confirmed by many miracles, inioined vvith threatnings, commended with promises: yet for all this, none of them were sufficient to sanctifie, or make ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the people vvith that holinesse, which is requisite to him that desireth to appeare innocent in the light of God, or to dwell in his Tabernacle. Therefore wee must seeke some other vses and ends, for which the Sacraments vvere ordained.</p>
                     <pb n="278" facs="tcp:2645:168"/>
                     <p>Generally, the vse and purpose of the Sacraments is, that by these outward signes vvee should be stirred vp to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend thorow faith the promises of God, and bee enfla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med with desire to pursue the same. If we wish to haue the matter made more plaine, there are fiue principall ends and scopes, for which Sacraments were ordained.</p>
                     <p>The first end is, that by them wee may be both generally and particularly instructed, how great the loue of Christ is vnto vs. Wherefore they are Gods Messengers vnto vs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the reconciliation betwixt God and vs in IESVS CHRIST: they are Rings of our spirituall marriage: they are Seales of our promised inheritance: they are Images and representations of the manifold blessings, which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed vnto vs in the Sonne of God: they are Glasses, in which wee may behold what Christ hath done and suffered for vs. And this vse Christ himselfe speaketh of;<note n="b" place="margin">Luke 22.19.</note>
                        <hi>Doe this in the remembrance of me. Austine</hi> saith, that in the celebra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereof wee are so moued, as though we saw Christ pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent vpon the Crosse before vs. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith;<note n="c" place="margin">Chrysost. in <hi>1.</hi> Cor. c. <hi>2.</hi> hom. <hi>7.</hi> ex Io Iuello in art c. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

For I doe not esteeme the things, which are seene by the sight, but I behold them with the eye of the minde. <hi>Ambrose</hi> saith; that is most seene, which is not seene. Finally, <hi>Austine</hi> teacheth, that in the Sacraments we must consider, not what they are, but what they signifie.</p>
                     <p>The Sacraments doe not onely testifie the generall loue of GOD to his whole Church: but they are also speciall Seales of the fauour of God to the particular conscience of euery man. Faith in a man, vvhen it meditateth on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises of God, doth easily acknowledge the stabilitie, the trueth and the sweetnes of them, because God is euerlasting, iust, and good: but it wauereth many times, and doubteth
<pb n="279" facs="tcp:2645:168"/> concerning the application of these promises, whether they appertaine to himselfe as well as to other. For this cause our God,<note n="d" place="margin">1. Tim. 2.4.</note>
                        <hi>who will haue all men to be saued,</hi> hath annexed to his word his Sacramēts, that we may in the receiuing of them be assured of Saluation in our particular. For in the Sacraments the spirit speaketh comfortably vnto vs, and saith; As our bodies are cleansed with the same materiall water, and fedde with the same materiall bread and wine with others: so the bloud of Christ doth cleanse our conscience, and his bodie doth feede our soules vnto eternall life, as well as others.<note n="e" place="margin">Ambr in Luc. l. <hi>5.</hi> c. <hi>7.</hi> ex Iuello.</note>
                        <hi>Ambrose</hi> well saith of the word; wee haue seene, and our eyes haue beheld, and wee haue thrust our fingers into the print of the nailes: For we seeme to our selues to haue seene whom we reade of, and to haue beheld him hanging on the Crosse, and to haue felt his wounds, by the searching of the spirit of the Church. <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith of the receiuing, of the Sacrament;<note n="f" place="margin">Cypr. de Coena do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini paulo post me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium tractatus.</note> We sticke vnto his Crosse, wee sucke his bloud, we thrust our tongues into the wounds of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer. And this is the first vse of Sacraments; To assure our conscience of the infinite loue of God towards vs.</p>
                     <p>The second vse of Sacraments is, to stirre vp in vs an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest desire and longing to attaine the promises of GOD, which by these outward elements are declared to bee so ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessarie, so profitable, so sweete and comfortable vnto vs. These teach vs with <hi>Dauid,</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The third vse is, that Christians by the contemplation and communicating of the Sacraments, should be together knit in a firme and assured bond of loue and charitie, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="280" facs="tcp:2645:169"/> one heart and one minde. This vse the Apostle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendeth vnto vs;<note n="m" place="margin">1. Cor. 10.17</note>
                        <hi>We that are many, are one bread and one body, because we are all partakers of one bread.</hi> Wherefore (as it may be gathered out of <hi>Iohn</hi>) immediately after his last Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, of which the last action was the institution of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments of his body and bloud, he added<note n="n" place="margin">Ioh. 13.34.</note>
                        <hi>a new comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dement, that they should loue one another, as hee had loued them. Anselme</hi> saith; wee breake and diuide the bread into many parts, to signifie the charitable vnion of the receiuers. <hi>Pauli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus</hi> vnto <hi>Austine</hi> saith; It is no maruell, if absent wee be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent amongst our selues, and vnknowne we know our selues, since we are members of one body, and haue one head, and are washed with one grace, and doe liue by one bread, walke in one way, and dwell in one house. <hi>Cyprian</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Cyprian.</note> saith; vvith what loue and concord all faithfull Christians are ioined together,<note place="margin">Chrysost.</note> the Lords Sacrifice doth declare. <hi>Chrysostom</hi> saith; we do embrace one another in the mysteries, that many may become one.<note place="margin">Hierom.</note>
                        <hi>Hierome</hi> saith; wee are all one bread and one body, as many as communicate of one bread.</p>
                     <p>The fourth vse is, to discerne vs from all other Sects and Religions by our publique Rites: for it is the couenant be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tweene God and vs. Wherefore, as<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 17.14.</note> they which were not circumcised, were not counted any of Gods people: so they which partake not of the Sacraments, are not reckoned in the fellowship of the members of Christ. The Militarie ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour is conferred by girding with a sword: The Ciuil honor is signified by the Robe: the Nuptiall bond by the Ring: so are the Sacraments the markes and cognisances of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. Therefore of circumcision <hi>Chrysostome</hi> saith, that it was the bridle and fetters vvhich vvithheld the Iewes, that they should not be mingled with other nations.</p>
                     <p>The fift vse is, to stirre vs vp to holinesse of life, and clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse of conuersation. This vse the Apostle noteth in the first to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">1. Cor. 10.2.</note> where hee sheweth, that many of the Iewes after they were in the Red Sea baptised vnto <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses,</hi> and had eaten the same spirituall meate, and drunke the same spirituall drinke: yet God was displeased with them, and
<pb n="281" facs="tcp:2645:169"/> ouerthrew them in the wildernesse, that they might bee en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>samples vnto vs, that we lust not after euill things: that wee bee not idolaters, nor fornicators, nor tempters of Christ, nor murmurers against God. For, as it vvas vvith the Iewes in the celebrating of their Sacraments, so it is vvith Christians. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith;<note n="p" place="margin">1. Cor. 10.21.</note>
                        <hi>Yee cannot bee partakers of the Lords Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and of the table of Diuels.</hi> In the next Chapter he denoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth, that<note n="q" place="margin">1. Cor. 11.27.</note>
                        <hi>Whosoeuer shall eate this bread, and drinke the cup of the Lord vnworthily, shall be guilty of the body and bloud of the Lord,</hi>

Wherefore the Apostle ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horteth euery man to examine himselfe, and so to eate of the bread, and drinke of the Cup.</p>

                     <p>Sundry praises therefore are giuen to the Sacraments, and they are called by the name of the things they signifie, and which in the right exercise of them we be partakers of.

All these are figuratiue speeches; and in them the things signified, and the things signifying, are called by the same names: yet the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are not changed in substance, but in dignitie, and of common creatures they are become holy. Now this holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse is not in the matter of them, but in the vse, by vvhich vse the receiuers also are changed, and renued in the spirit
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:2645:172"/> of their mindes, through the operation of the Spirit of God. The ancient Fathers vse this amplification of vvords, and powerfull tearmes to stirre vp deuotion in the receiuers: But these praises tend not to the magnifying of the signe, but of the thing signified.</p>
                     <p>It remaineth now to search in what sense all these honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Attributes, both by the Scripture and the Fathers haue beene giuen to the Sacraments. This we shall the better doe, if we set before our eyes the definition, or nature of a Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>Austine</hi> defining a Sacrament saith, it is the visible signe of inuisible grace. <hi>Hugo de Sancto Ʋictore</hi> saith, it is a materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riall element outwardly proposed to the eye, presenting a similitude according to the institution, and by sanctification conferring inuisible grace.

                        </note> the visible instrument, which God vseth, to stir vp faith withall. Againe,<note n="o" place="margin">Ibid.</note> a Sacrament is the promise of God concerning forgiuenesse of sins by Christ, sealed and signed by an outward and visible signe of Gods instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. If we conferre all these assertions together, we shall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue, that some make a Sacrament to consist of two parts: the <hi>Element,</hi> and the <hi>Word;</hi> and some of three: the element, the word, and the inuisible grace. And according to this last opinion, if any of these be vvanting, the Sacrament is not compleate. If there be no materiall signe, there can bee no Sacrament at all: If you take the word from the Element, what<note n="p" place="margin">Aug tract. <hi>80.</hi> super Io. paulo post medium.</note> doth remaine but water (saith <hi>Austin:</hi>) And the spirituall grace is so necessarie, that <hi>Austine</hi> againe saith, the visible Sacrament vvithout the inuisible sanctification, though it be present, it doth not profit. Wherefore vvhen
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:2645:172"/> the Scriptures and Fathers attribute such great power vnto Sacraments; to purge, to cleanse, to sanctifie, this must not bee vnderstood in one part or two parts of the Sacrament: Of the Elements onely, or the vvords onely: but of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleate Sacrament, vvhich doth consist of the signe, the word, and the inuisible grace.</p>
                     <p>A Sacrament thus vnderstood doth sanctifie: but euery part thereof must haue that vertue onely attributed vnto it, which it properly hath. The signe and the words are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments to moue our vnderstanding and will, to imbrace the grace which is offered: but inward grace is the thing, which doth sanctifie, and it proceedeth neither from the water, nor the word, but from the Spirit of God onely, as from the efficient cause.</p>
                     <p>The signe conferreth not grace, the word conferreth not grace: but he which hath instituted them giueth grace, not to them, but to vs in the godly vse of them.</p>
                     <p>When we say, that grace of sanctification is tied vnto a Sacrament, we vnderstand it of a Sacrament, which hath all three parts thereto belonging; according to the common definition; A Sacrament is the visible signe of inuisible grace. If there be no inuisible grace, there is then no Sacrament: yet this visible grace is not conferred by the signe, but expressed: it is not contained in the element, but declared.</p>
                     <p>When we say, the Sacrament doth sanctifie, we doe not meane, that the signe onely is the Sacrament, or that the signe ioined to the word is the Sacrament; but wee call the signe, the word, and the grace, all three ioined together, a Sacrament: for inward grace is as the soule and life of the Sacraments. Wherefore the Romish Church it selfe calleth <hi>grace the matter of the Sacrament.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>When wee say, that Sacraments doe worke in vs eternall life, we meane not, that God hath ordained Sacraments to effect and giue vs his promises, but to seale them and witnes them vnto vs.</p>
                     <p>When we say, Sacraments are instruments to eternall life, it must not be vnderstood, that they are such instruments of
<pb n="286" facs="tcp:2645:173"/> Saluation, as the common materiall bread is of naturall nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rishment: for spirituall things cannot be giuen by corporall causes; nor eternall things, by temporall causes. Therefore when we say, that grace is ioined and annexed to the visible Sacrament, wee doe not meane, that it is by naturall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction, as bread and drinke haue the nutritiue power in them: nor by locall coniunction, as the bread and wine are mingled together in the cup: nor by corporall coniunction, as the members are knit together in one body: nor by the cō<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iunction of ineuitable necessitie, as though God had simply granted life eternall to euery one, that participateth of the outward element: nor yet by effectuall coniunction, as the power of the fire is in the Iron, both vvhen wee vse it, and when we vse it not: But we account the outward Symboles instruments of grace, <hi>Non Physica sed Moralia,</hi> not instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments or vessels inherently containing grace in themselues or effectually infusing it into vs. For as the power to create, So to infuse grace is onely in GOD, not communicable to any creature. But the outward Symboles, are sacred meanes and instruments, In the due and deuout vse whereof according to Christs institution, God doth immediately and inuisibly infuse grace into our hearts, and doth it, <hi>Ex pacto &amp; foedere,</hi> hauing tied himselfe by his promise to conuey and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibite vnto vs his inuisible grace when we duely and deuout<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly receiue visible and holy Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>When the Fathers say the <hi>Eucharist</hi> is a sacrifice, they doe not meane, that it is a sacrifice of reconciliation, as the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ was: but of thanksgiuing, as the Scripture cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth the inuocation and celebration of the Name of GOD,<note n="q" place="margin">Ose 14.3.</note>
                        <hi>The Calues of our lips:</hi> yea, properly they vnderstand our thanksgiuing to be the sacrifice, not the Sacrament, which is so called figuratiuely; because when wee doe celebrate the holy <hi>Eucharist,</hi> wee doe it vvith the sacrifice of praise and thanksgiuing, setting out the death of the Lord till his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming againe.</p>
                     <p>We doe not thinke, that these mysteries are made holy by mans consecration, or by any power or efficacie inherent in
<pb n="287" facs="tcp:2645:173"/> the words and syllables pronounced: but that the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are holy by reason of the Lords institution it selfe. <hi>Gregory</hi> and <hi>Platina</hi> witnesse, that <hi>Peter</hi> the Apostle did vse onely the Lords Prayer at the celebration of the <hi>Eucharist:</hi> And the <hi>Grecians</hi> vse not the Latine forme in <hi>Baptisme:</hi> And yet, I trust, the Romish Church will not deny, but that <hi>Peter</hi> ministred the Sacrament of the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> and the <hi>Grecians</hi> of <hi>Baptisme.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There is another rule also, which out of this doctrine doth arise, that Sacraments are no longer such, then while they are in vse: When they are not in vse, they lose the name, and the dignitie of Sacraments.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, the Sonne of God doth merite all blessings for vs: the Father, for his Sonne and vvith his Sonne, by the operation of the Spirit giueth them vnto vs. Thus God and the Sacraments haue the honour due vnto them, when wee seeke forgiuenesse and grace onely from God, and doe place the merite and cause onely in Christ, the efficacie of the worke onely in the holy Ghost, and esteeme the Sacraments as externall signes, obsignations, Seales and images; to vvitnesse, confirme, exhibite, and present these benefites vnto vs.</p>

                              <item>In the old Testament there were many Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; in the new Testament there are two only: according to that of <hi>Austine</hi>

                              <item>The Sacraments of the Lawe were prenun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiations of Christ to come: the Sacraments of the Gospel are annuntiations that he is come; and in this sense are <hi>Austines</hi> words to bee vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood, when he sayth: the old Sacraments do promise saluation; the new doe giue salua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: that is, the old speake of a benefite to come; the new, of a benefite performed.</item>
                              <item>The Sacraments of the Lawe were subiect to change and mutation. For after one fashi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ought things to be signified, which shall be fulfilled: and after another fashion, which are fulfilled. But the Sacraments of the Gospell cannot be changed, they must endure as long as the Church is militant.</item>
                              <item>The old and new Sacraments differ in the variety of the signe. The Iewes had Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cision, sacrifices, feasts: we haue water, bread and wine. In the Iewish Sacraments there was often effusion of bloud: of mans bloud in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumcision; of beasts bloud in sacrificing: But in the Sacraments of the Gospell there is no ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusion of bloud: but they witnesse the bloud of Christ to be shed once for all.</item>
                              <item>The auncient Sacraments were more ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scure and dark then the new. They drew the picture in the first lines, in darke clowdes and shadowes: but the Sacraments of the Gospell are most perspicuous, and with liuely flouri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shing colours depaint the benefites of Gods grace vnto vs. The Church was neuer with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="291" facs="tcp:2645:175"/> Christ, but to some hee giueth harder les<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, to some more easie: to some he was more obscurely declared, to others more plainly. In the lawe of Nature, hee was as the wheate in the grasse: In the Lawe of <hi>Moses,</hi> as wheate in the stalke: In the Gospell, as wheate in the eare, fully, plainly, openly.</item>
                              <item>The Sacraments of the Lawe, for the most part, signified future things: The Sacraments of the Gospell present vnto vs things past, things present, and things to come.</item>

                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 7.2 Gen. 2.18</note>First, Matrimony, which was ordained to be a remedy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst sinne, a mutuall comfort and an helpe to mankinde, they say, is a Sacrament. But against this there are many rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="1"/> First, there is no iniunction that euery one should be mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, as it is that euery one should be baptized, and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate of the table of the Lord: But if Christ had ordained it as a Seale and Badge of Saluation, and a necessarie rite testifying his grace, it should be enioyned to all, as well as to some.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, there is no externall signe &amp; symboll therein. In some places they vse the Ring, in some they ioyne hands: but these are not commanded by God; therefore they be not Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall signes, according to the rule of <hi>Pighius</hi> himselfe, who saith;<note n="e" place="margin">Sacramentum est signum efficax diui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuus institutū. &amp;c.</note> A Sacrament is an efficacious signe ordained by God.</p>

                        <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, there is no promise annexed to Matrimony con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning forgiuenesse of sinne.<note place="margin">Ob.</note> They obiect, that Matrimony <hi>doth signifie the coniunction, which is betwixt Christ &amp; his Church; therefore it is a Sacrament.</hi> The answer is easie; euery thing that resembleth the benefits of Christ to his Church,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> is not a Sacrament: then were leauen, mustard-seed, the way, the dore, the key, Sacraments.</p>

                        <hi>a Mystery;</hi> therefore it is a Sacrament. Euery thing that is called a Mystery, is not a Sacrament. The Apostle calleth the obstinacy of the Iews, till the fulnes of the Gentiles be come, <hi>a Mystery:</hi> the doctrine of resurrection, the vocation of the Gentiles, the incarnation of Christ, <hi>Mysteries:</hi> yet these are not Sacraments, as all men knowe.</p>

                        <hi>Order,</hi> they say, is a Sacrament, <hi>and Imposition of hands the visible signe of the same:</hi> For the Apostle exhorteth <hi>Timothy</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">1 Tim. 5.22</note>
                        <hi>to lay hands on no man suddenly.</hi> And againe,<note n="h" place="margin">2. Tim. 1.6</note>
                        <hi>Stirre vp the grace which is in thee, by the laying on of hands:</hi> Notwithstanding
<pb n="295" facs="tcp:2645:177"/> all this, <hi>Order</hi> is no Sacrament. For there is no promise of forgiuenes of sinne annexed vnto it, as is properly vnto Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments. Ministers haue onely power to preach the word, &amp; distribute the Sacraments by this Ceremony of laying on hands. Imposition of hands in the Apostles time was a mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous action, by which the holy Ghost was giuen, and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eases cured: but imposition of hands now hath no such force, it is onely a kinde of praier, or gesture in praier, by which we doe testifie, that we commend the person ordered to the grace of GOD. Now, all signifying Ceremonies are not Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                     <p>Penance also is a Sacrament in the Romish account: but it hath no visible signe; therefore it is not a Sacrament. Some say, <hi>Imposition of hands is the signe:</hi> but God hath ordai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned no such rite; therefore it cannot bee a sacramentall rite. Some say, <hi>The sighs and groanes of the conscience vnder the burthen of sinne, is the materiall signe in penance:</hi> but such groanes and sighs are not visible; therefore they be not sacramentall. And the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Councell therefore saith,<note n="i" place="margin">Quasi materiam sacramenti poenitē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae. sess. <hi>4</hi> Can. <hi>4</hi> Si quis negauerit ad integram &amp;c.</note> that <hi>Contrition, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> are, as it were, <hi>the matter of the Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Penance; not the true matter, but as it vvere the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Moreouer, they witnesse vnto vs Mans compunction: but they are not seales of Gods promise. Of the Couenant of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation there are two parts; one from God: another from vs. Sorrowe for sinne is our part of the Couenant:<note place="margin">2. Cor. 7.10 Luke 5.21</note> forgiuenesse of sinne is Gods part. Now sighing and lamentation is the witnes on our p, rt, that we gladly desire to imbrace the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse of our sinnes: but where is the materiall witnes on Gods behalfe: as the water, bread, and wine doe witnes both in Baptisme, and the <hi>Eucharist,</hi> that hee freely forgiueth vs? To conclude, what better witnes can bee brought to proue that Penance is no sacrament, then <hi>Alexander</hi> and <hi>Bonauen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</hi> who both confesse that <hi>Christ was not the authour therof.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Confirmation</hi> had this beginning: It was thought a godly policie, that Infants, which at baptisme were not able to make confession of their faith; when they came to lawfull
<pb n="296" facs="tcp:2645:178"/> yeares, should before the Bishop make publique protestation thereof; which being done, the Bishop laid his hands vpon them, beeing the gesture which was vsed in his prayer, desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God to strengthen their faith, and to poure his blessings vpon them. Christ himselfe indeede laid his hands vpon children, but he did not require of them profession of faith; Wherefore they cannot say, that Christ was the author of this Rite of Confirmation: and we may iustly deny it to be a Sacrament, because it is not instituted by God.</p>
                     <p>Many toyes Popery hath added to Confirmation, neither haue they retained the Primitiue guise thereof. For they a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noint the confirmed with oile, they crosse him, they giue him a blowe, in token that hee must bee prepared to battell. All which are neither the ordinances of Christ nor his Apostles: and yet such is their blindnesse, that Confirmation, which is no institution of Christ, nor is retained according to the Primitiue vse, is preferred with them before all other Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and can bee administred by none but by a Bishop onely.</p>
                     <p>Extreame vnction hath no commandement nor promise of forgiuenesse of sinne in the holy Scripture. Christ sent his Apostles forth, and they anointed the sicke with oyle, and they did recouer. This is nothing to the forgiuenes of sins: It was a miracle,<note place="margin">Ioh. 9.6. Act. 5.15.</note> but not a Sacrament; Euen as the Spettle and the earth, which Christ anointed the eies of the blinde withall: The shadow of <hi>Peter,</hi> the beds and the couches brought forth into the streets: Kerchefs from the body of <hi>Paul</hi> sent vnto the sick. These all are wondrous vvorkes, by which God glorified his Sonne, and promoted the Gospell: but they are not in the number of Sacraments sealing to vs forgiuenesse of sinnes. In our daies such Ceremonies haue not the same power that they had in the Primitiue Church, because the truth is sufficiently confirmed vvith miracles already. Therefore, vvhat should they vse the oile without the vertue?</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XC.</hi> How the Romish Church corrupteth and peruerteth the vse of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments.</head>
                     <p>AMongst all the dregs of the Babylonish cup, wherewith the scarlet strumpet doth make the Nations of the world drunken, &amp; infatuateth the people, I think there is none more venemous, nor full of perill, then that the holy Sacraments of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, contrarie to his eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall counsaile and appointed end, are sundry waies turned vnto strange and superstitious vses.</p>
                     <p>The first abuse is; where CHRIST ordained them to bee Seales of grace onely, they make them vessels contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning grace. Christ appointed, that they should signifie our iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stification and saluation in his bloud: they say, they are Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation and iustification through Christ. Christ ordained them to be Testimonies of good things: they say, they are the good things themselues. So the shadow is turned into the substance, and the wedding Ring is made the husband selfe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they peruert the vse of Sacraments, aswell those which are ordained by Christ, as those which thēselues haue deuised. Baptisme they make of no vertue, but keepe onely the outward Ceremonie for fashions sake: but they attribute and communicate the power thereof to all the superstitions which themselues haue added.<note place="margin">

                        <hi>CHAP. XCIII.</hi> That the Romish Church peruerteth the vse of the holy Eucharist, by turning the Sacrament into a Sacrifice.</head>
                     <p>THat the holy <hi>Eucharist</hi> is sometime called a sacrifice by the ancient Fathers, for that we in the receiuing thereof giue thankes to God for his incomparable benefits in Iesus Christ, there is no man can deny; and surely the ground hereof is very good. For the onely Sacrifice, which is now left vnto the church, is that of prayer and thanksgiuing,<note n="a" place="margin">Osee 14.3.</note>
                        <hi>The Calues of our lips;</hi> as the Scripture calleth it.</p>
                     <p>Now, because at the celebration of the holy <hi>Eucharist</hi> chiefely and with greatest magnificence, we giue praises and thankes to God for the death of his Sonne, therefore many times the Sacrament it selfe is called the Sacrifice, though vnproperly, because in receiuing thereof we alwaies offer vp the sacrifice of thanksgiuing.</p>
                     <p>In place of this holy and vnbloudy Sacrifice, the Romish priest contendeth, that he <hi>euery day offereth vp the very natural flesh and bloud of Christ vnto God the Father</hi> for the forgiuenes of the sins of the quicke and the dead. But this is a figment iniurious to Christ, monstrous in his Church, abominable to God, and to men offensiue. Against which, sundry reasons may be produced; I will content my selfe with a few.</p>
                     <p>My first Reason I take out of the word of our Sauiour Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ; who, ordaining this holy Ceremonie, doth not
<pb n="312" facs="tcp:2645:186"/> onely command what shall bee done, but also sheweth to what end and purpose it should be done,<note n="b" place="margin">Luke 22.19.</note>
                        <hi>Doe this</hi> (saith he) <hi>in remembrance of me.</hi> Wherefore the end of this instituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is a remembrance of Christ. And this is the exposition of the Apostle <hi>Paul;</hi> which hee most exactly instructing his <hi>Corinthians</hi> in the Doctrine of the Sacrament, maketh of Christs words.<note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 11.16.</note>
                        <hi>For as often as ye shal eate</hi> (saith he) <hi>this bread, and drink this Cup, ye shew the Lords death till he come.</hi> It is ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore euident, that the end of Christs institution was, that we should continue in the church alwaies to the end of the world an honourable remembrance of his death &amp; Passion.</p>
                     <p>The second argument I take out of the Apostle to the He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brewes: who shewing that vnto the Priests office it is inci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to offer for sinne, addeth;<note n="d" place="margin">Heb 5 4.</note>
                        <hi>No man taketh this honour vpon him, but he which is called of God, as Aaron was:</hi> but the Romish Priests haue no calling in the old or new Testament to offer vp Christs flesh vnto God in sacrifice; therefore it may not be granted vnto them.</p>
                     <p>If they say they haue any such authoritie, let them shew vs their commission, and their calling with the ceremonies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing thereto. Christ said;<note n="e" place="margin">Mar. 16.15</note>
                        <hi>Goe and preach:</hi> Christ said;<note n="f" place="margin">Math 28.19.</note>
                        <hi>Baptize in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the holy Ghost:</hi> and of the <hi>Eucharist</hi> he said, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> but he neuer said; Doe this to take away your sinnes: he neuer said; sacrifice me, offer me vp to God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, this figment of the offering vp of Christ for sinne by the Priest, doth plainely crosse the whole drift of the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. For of the Scripture the scope is, to shew that Christ<note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 10.14.</note>
                        <hi>with one offering hath consecrated for euer them that are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> And the Apostle, lest wee should thinke that this one offering might yet be often renued, saith,<note n="h" place="margin">Heb. 10.10.</note>
                        <hi>Wee are sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied euen by the offering vp of the body of Christ once for all.</hi> Ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore where Christ once sanctifieth and taketh away sin, there needs no further sanctification, nor taking away of sinne. <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi> saith,<note n="i" place="margin">Esay 53.5.</note>

                     <p>Fourthly, this figment of offering vp of Christ by the priest for the sinnes of the quicke and the dead is ouerthrowne by themselues.

                     <p>Lastly, the Romish Church teacheth, that the offering Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cramentall doth not take away all sinnes, but the lesser, and the smaller sinnes: which the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Councel insinuateth, saying,<note n="p" place="margin">Con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>AS the Oratour said of the Romane <hi>Augurs,</hi> that he mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uelled a Southsayer did not laugh, when he saw a South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sayer, knowing in their owne conscience with what fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shoods they abused the people: the same may I truely say of this <hi>Chymana,</hi> this Monster, this idoll of Transubstantiati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Against which the reasons are so plaine, the arguments so many, the proofe so euident, that no man, except hee be forsaken of all iudgement in spirituall things, nay, of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, can beleeue it. As compendiously as I can, omit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the numerositie of conclusions against this figment, which in sundry good authors may bee found, I will onely set before thee (discreet Reader) a few demonstrations, which I doubt not, will sufficiently confute the vanity of this ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination.</p>
                     <p>The first argument shall be from the words of the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution themselues. They complaine they cannot, nor dare not deny the truth of Christs saying; <hi>This is my body: neither doe we.</hi> But of the vnderstanding, and the construction or meaning of the words is the controuersie.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Obserue.</note>It is a certaine and true Canon in expounding Scriptures, that one place must not be opposed against many, but the fewer must bee expounded by the more in number, and the doubtfull by those that are plaine: Neither doe we euer make a true exposition of any one text of Scripture, but vvhen the dignitie, the authoritie, and the veritie of all other sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Scripture, are equally and inuiolably preserued. Wherefore the Romish Prelates vniustly enforce one short
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:2645:187"/> sentence against many, and foure words against such a cloud of witnesses, as the Scripture on the contrary side admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>streth: yea, they are most faulty, who allow of no other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the words, <hi>This is my body,</hi> but such as is plainely repugnant to the whole course of Scriptures: and yet let vs examine the words themselues, and no such por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent can be gathered out of them, as the <hi>Archimago</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> maintaineth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iesus tooke bread, and when he had giuen thankes, hee brake it, and gaue it to them, saying, Take, eate, this is my body. Luke</hi> ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth,<note n="a" place="margin">Luke 22.19.</note>
                        <hi>which is giuen for you, this doe in the remembrance of me.</hi> Notwithstanding the diuers opinions, and disputation of Sophisters touching the word, <hi>This,</hi> it must needs in sim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitie of vnderstanding be referred to that which Christ had in his hands: but that by the consent of all the Euange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lists was Bread; therefore, <hi>This,</hi> that is, the Bread, must bee his body. The Bread may not vanish, the Bread may not be taken away, but Bread still remaineth: else our Sauiours proposition cannot be true, <hi>This,</hi> (meaning the Bread) <hi>is my body.</hi> Such interpretation must bee made of the words, as the tearmes of the proposition may stand still: which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be, except it be Bread and Body. Wherefore, if wee fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the Grammaticall sense, that opinion which taketh a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way bread in the Sacrament, falsifieth the words of Christ: but the opinion which saith the Sacrament is both Bread and Body (the bread naturally, the body figuratiuely) agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with the very forme of Christs words.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>When</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Luke 22.19.</note>
                        <hi>he had giuen thankes, hee brake it, and gaue to them.</hi> This connexion sheweth, that it was the very same he gaue, which hee brake: but it was <hi>Bread,</hi> which hee brake: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it was Bread, which hee gaue. No man can say, that he brake one thing, and gaue another, since the Euangelists vse one and the same tearme; <hi>He brake it, and gaue. Which is gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen for you:</hi> these words are not referred to the signe which he brake and distributed, but to his owne naturall body, of which hee spake in the <hi>Present tense; It is giuen for you,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was speedily to be giuen. For if that which he held in
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:2645:188"/> his hands, were the thing which was giuen for them, then doubtlesse he was broken, and bruised, and suffered before he was betraied: for, that which hee held in his hands, hee brake, and bade them, <hi>Take, and eate.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In that he saith, <hi>Doe this in remembrance of me:</hi> it is plaine, that he did not meane, that his naturall body and bloud should be carnally and really vnder the formes of bread and wine. For he saith, <hi>Doe this,</hi> that is, take and eate: but no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber man will thinke, that Christ would haue his impassible, glorious, immortall body, after his resurrection broken or eaten: surely he did not say; Consecrate as I consecrate, or speake as I speake: but he commandeth vs to do as he did: he brake that he gaue, shall we breake his body?</p>
                     <p>No man can say, that the bread is any otherwaies the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of Christ, then the wine is his bloud: now hee calleth not the wine his bloud simply, or the bloud of his body, but respectiuely, and in lome sort.<note n="c" place="margin">Math. 26.28.</note>
                        <hi>This is my bloud of the New Testament,</hi> that is (as <hi>Luke</hi> expoundeth) the New Testament in his bloud: and <hi>Luke</hi> nameth not the wine, but,<note n="d" place="margin">Luke 22.20.</note>
                        <hi>This Cup is the New Testament in my bloud.</hi> So that, if wee cleaue to the very letter, it is not the wine, but the cup it selfe, which is changed; not into bloud, but into <hi>The New Testament of his bloud.</hi> Wherefore as the Romanists themselues cannot deny that the words of Saint <hi>Luke</hi> are figuratiue; <hi>This cup is the New Testament in my bloud:</hi> so are the other also, <hi>This is my body.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>My second argument against Transubstantiation, is the manifold authorities of the Scripture which plainely im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugne the same.

                     <p>To this let me adde the Doctrine of Saint <hi>Paul,</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 10.17.</note>
                        <hi>We are all one bread and one body, because wee all are partakers of one
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:2645:188"/> bread:</hi> But the Popish Transubstantiation doth altogether ouerthrow this inference and conclusion; for it taketh away the bread in the Sacrament, and it denieth that we partake of any bread therein.</p>
                     <p>Christ telleth his Disciples, that<note n="i" place="margin">Ioh. 16.28.29.</note>
                        <hi>He leaueth the world and goeth vnto the Father:</hi> the Disciples answered; Now thou speakest plainely, and without Parables. Wherefore it is ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest, that Christs words are to be vnderstood literally, and not figuratiuely. For hee speaketh plainely, that his naturall body must forsake the world, and bee taken vp to heauen: neither can it returne againe till his great and second appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, when we shall behold him. For so the Scriptures doe witnesse;<note n="k" place="margin">Act. 3.21.</note>
                        <hi>The heauens must containe him vntill the time that all things be restored:</hi> Neither is hee so contained in heauen, that he is contained in the earth also. For he saith;<note n="l" place="margin">Math. 26.11.</note>
                        <hi>Mee you shall not haue alwaies with you.</hi> Which words must be vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood of his bodily presence. I will conclude these testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, out of the words of the Apostle to the <hi>Hebrewes,</hi> who saith;<note n="m" place="margin">Heb. 10▪ 12.</note> This man, <hi>After he had offered one sacrifice for sinnes, fitteth for euer at the right hand of God,</hi> nothing can bee more plaine: the meaning of the words is, that Christ hath finished all his businesse of sacrificing and cleansing sinne, and now enioyeth a glorious Sabbath of rest, sitting at the right hand of God for euer: not for a time, not for some season with discontinuation from thence, and negotiation other where, but <hi>at the right hand of God for euer.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third argument against Transubstantiation is taken from the comparison with all other Sacraments. <hi>The Rock,</hi> the Apostle saith, <hi>was Christ:</hi> yet no man will say, that the <hi>Rocke</hi> was Transubstantiate into <hi>Christ.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">1. Cor. 10.4. Gal. 3.27.</note>
                        <hi>Baptisme is the putting on of Christ:</hi> yet no man will say, that the flesh and bloud of Christ is naturally vpon vs.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, experience teacheth, that the substance of the bread and wine is not changed: for it hath the same proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that other naturall bread hath; colour, taste, nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, putrefaction, corruption.<note n="o" place="margin">Marti Polon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>himselfe to be an offring, and a sacrifice of sweet smelling sauour vnto God,</hi> saieth the Apostle. And if the Legall Sacrifices at any time be called Sauours of rest, or sacrifices of sweet sauour vnto God, it is not in respect of the things themselues, but for that they were Images and representations of the great Sacrifice of Christ,
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:2645:193"/> who is come in their place, and is now a generall offering, an euerlasting offering, a sufficient offering for all that beleeue in him.</p>
                     <p>Hee is a generall offering; for that, whatsoeuer the sixe sundry kindes of Iewish offerings did signifie, <hi>Christ is vnto vs.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, hee is an eternall offering:<note place="margin">Heb. 10.10.</note> for though he offred vp his body actually but once, yet the vertue of this Sacrifice was from the beginning, and indures to the end: his wounds were open before he had them, and his bloud neuer dry, but alwaies God beheld it, and was pacified in it towards Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinde, both before hee suffered, and after. In this sense hee is called<note n="m" place="margin">Apoc. 13.8</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, he is a sufficient sacrifice, a superabundant price for all offences: in respect of whose worthinesse, all the trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Wherefore <hi>Iob</hi> as the type and figure of Christ, maketh his punishment as great as his sinne, and his correction answereable to his offences;<note n="n" place="margin">Iob 6.2.3.</note>
                        <hi>O that my griefe were well weighed, and my miseries were laide toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the balance: for it would bee now heauier then the sand of the sea.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Sacrifice of Christ being then generall, eternall, suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, it taketh away all other Sacrifices whatsoeuer: neyther can they be offered any more without vnspeakeable iniury &amp; reproach vnto the Sonne of God.</p>
                     <p>This notwithstanding, hee that opposeth himselfe against all that is called God, will haue his offerings, his gifts, his Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, his altars: the superstitious smoake whereof obscu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the benefits, and hides from mens eies the glorious obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our great high Priest.

                     <p>In the name they agree; for they call them oblations, gifts, Sacrifices, incense, sweet sauours; as in the consecration of

                     </p>
                     <p>Let vs now shew the reasons, which plainly ouerthrow this Poeticall <hi>Chimaera</hi> of the Romish Church.</p>
                     <p>First, our Sauiour Christ, nor his Apostles make no three<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold deuision of men: <hi>Good, Euill, Indifferent,</hi> as the Papists do. But our Sauiour diuideth all men into<note n="p" place="margin">Io. 3.6.</note>
                        <hi>Spirit</hi> and <hi>Flesh, Wheate</hi> and <hi>Tares, Beleeuers</hi> and <hi>Ʋnbeleeuers:</hi> and he assigneth only two places vnto the Soules out of this world departing.<note n="q" place="margin">Io. 5.24.</note>
                        <hi>Hee that heareth my word, and beleeueth in him that sent mee, hath euerlasting life, and shall not come into condemnation, but pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth from death vnto life.</hi> And againe,<note n="r" place="margin">Io. 3.18.</note>
                        <hi>Hee that beleeueth in
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:2645:197"/> him, shall not be condemned, but hee that beleeueth not, is condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned already.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> most carefully instructing his<note n="s" place="margin">1. Cor. 15.</note>
                        <hi>Corin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thians,</hi> and his <hi>Thessalonians</hi> of the state of the dead, speaketh not any word of Purgatory: and yet else where hee witnes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seth, that <hi>he</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">Acts 20.20.</note>
                        <hi>had kept backe nothing that was profitable,</hi> but vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered vnto his auditors all the counsell of God. And who knoweth not, that<note n="u" place="margin">2. Cor. 12.2.</note> he was taken vp into the third heauen, where he saw vneffable things? If he sawe this, why did hee not reueale it, that Masses and Dirges, and Trentalls, and such other offices might bee done for the dead? Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> also had diuers Reuelations,<note place="margin">Apoc. 20.</note> whereof some were concerning the dead, and their resurrection, but not a word in any of them touching Purgatorie.<note place="margin">1. Pet. 4. 2. Pet. 2.</note> Saint <hi>Peter</hi> in his Epistles rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soneth much of the punishment of them that walke inor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinately, and after their owne Lusts. He speaketh also of the day of the Lord,<note place="margin">2. Pet. 3.</note> and of his comming, but of Purgatorie not a syllable.</p>
                     <p>To conclude this argument, in the whole volume there is not one word Cathegorically, plainly and distinctly set downe, by which Purgatorie, an Article of the Romish faith, a matter of such vnspeakable weight, a generall <hi>Necessity</hi> ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vpon men, is taught or deliuered.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the figment of Purgatorie is plainly against the Catholicke and Apostolicall faith contained in the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Creed, wherein it is confessed; <hi>I beleeue the remission of sinnes.</hi> Where remission is, what punishment can there be? If sinnes be punished according to the offence, they are not remitted; if they be remitted, they are not punished.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Though the body in hell suffer ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriall fire, the soule doth not so.</note>Thirdly, the dreame of Purgatorie is against naturall rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For how can the Soule, that is an vncorporall sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, suffer in corporall fire? The worme, the fire, the brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stone in Scripture, wherewith the Soules are tormented, are Metaphorically to be vnderstood.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, this dotage of Purgatorie doth contradict the whole scope of Scriptures; whereof the end is to shew, that Iesus Christ is a full, absolute, and compleate Redeemer: not
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:2645:197"/> a parcell Sauiour, nor halfe a Sauiour, but such a one, as hath himselfe borne our sinnes, and was wounded, that wee might be cured: Hee hath not satisfied for the fault onely, and left vs to satisfie for the punishment, but hath exactly sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied the lawe, and susteined our paines; as <hi>Esay</hi> witnesseth,<note n="w" place="margin">Esay 53.5.</note>
                        <hi>He was wounded for our transgressions, hee was broken for our iniquities.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, this phantasticall mockerie of Purgatorie deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth that sweete rest to the Soules of Christian men, which God in his holy, word abundantly promiseth, saying;<note n="x" place="margin">Apo. 14.13.</note>
                        <hi>Blessed are the dead, which hereafter dye in the Lord; euen so saith the Spirit, for they rest from their labours, and their workes follow them.</hi> What blessing, what rest, is to them that in mercilesse flames of hellish fire are so long and lamentably tormented?</p>
                     <p>The Scripture calleth the death of the godly, <hi>Sleepe.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Deut. 31.16. 1. Thes. 4.13. 1. King. 2.10. Math. 27.52.</note> Surely it might better bee called rosting or broyling, horror and slaughter, if the Soules departed go hence into such fearefull paines aboue all that euer was in the world indured.</p>
                     <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">1. Cor. 15.55, 56, 57.</note> glorieth ouer death, and the graue, and the Lawe, <hi>by that victory which we haue thorow our Lord Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ.</hi> But there is no iust cause of such boasting, if wee be still held vnder the Law, to satisfie in our owne persons, induring the vnspeakable torment and tortures of Hell, no man knoweth how long.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, and lastly, in <hi>Leuiticus</hi> and other bookes of the Law, all maner of Sacrifices are described both generally and specially: but amongst all those sundrie kinds of gifts, oblati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, sacrifices, burnt-offerings, peace-offerings, sinne-offe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings, there is not any oblation, gift, or sacrifice for the dead.</p>

                     <p>This of all other is the most a syllogisticall or vnconclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding argument. For here it appeareth,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that Christ suffered his Purgatorie in this life: for after this life ended, hee saith to the Thiefe, this day thou shalt bee with mee in Paradise.

                        <hi>Pope Ioane</hi> was deliuered of a childe; <hi>Ergo Paul</hi> the fift is not lawfully elected. This conclusion is as necessarie as the other.

                        </note> they labour to confirme Purgatorie. For the Apostle saith;<note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 3.15.</note>
                        <hi>If any mans worke burne, he shall lose, but he shall bee saued himselfe, neuerthelesse yet as it were by the fire.</hi>

                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Sol.</note>This place is not literally to be vnderstood. For how can the worke it selfe, or the labour of the Minister burne? It is therefore a Metaphor: which the Apostle vseth, to shew that if the hearers of any Minister shrinke from the faith, and fall from religion, though there be losse of his trauaile, yet hee himselfe after the enduring of many tribulations (as all the other members of Christ doe) shall be saued. To this I may adde, that the Apostle doth not say, that he shall be saued by fire; but <hi>as it were by fire:</hi> so that it is euident, that the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle doth not speake of true and naturall fire, but of Metapho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall fire; for affliction is in sundry places of the Scripture called fire. <hi>Peter</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">1. Pet. 1.7.</note> compareth the faith of the church to <hi>gold tried in the fire.</hi> The Psalmist also of the affliction of <hi>Israel</hi> saith;<note n="k" place="margin">Psal. 66.12.</note>
                        <hi>thou sufferedst men to ride ouer our heads: wee went through fire and water, and thou broughtest vs into a wealthy place.</hi> I conclude therefore, since the words of the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> speake of Metaphoricall fire, this place cannot bee vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stood of the fire of Purgatorie, which the common consent of the Romish schoole affirmeth,<note n="l" place="margin">Bell. de Purg. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>11.</hi> in ipso prime cap.</note> to be true, proper, ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentarie

                     <p>Let vs now see how by this false coined figment of their Purgatorie, the high and honourable office of Iesus Christs Priesthood is wronged.</p>
                     <p>First, it maketh Christ an vnsufficient redeemer, who hath not cleansed vs fully from our sinnes: but hath onely prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the way, that we may satisfie for our owne sinnes in our owne persons. This doctrine is contrarie to the teaching of <hi>Iohn;</hi>
                        <note n="z" place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.7.</note>
                        <hi>The bloud of Iesus Christ his Sonne purgeth vs from all vnrighteousnesse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Secondly, it taketh away from the dignitie of Christs Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice, which (they say) doth onely satisfie for the guilt of sinne, but not for the whole punishment.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, by this figment of Purgatorie, an idle distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is brought in concerning sinnes veniall, and mortall, by which the Maiestie of God is wronged; as though there were any thing committed against God by man, which is not mortall in man. The Scripture maketh all sinne deadly.
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:2645:202"/> For the Apostle saith;<note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 5.14.</note>

                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>r them also, that sinned, not after the like manner of the transgression of</hi> Adam: And againe, of all sinnes generally he saith;<note n="a" place="margin">Rom. 6 23.</note>
                        <hi>The wages of sinne is death. Iohn</hi> indeede saith,<note n="b" place="margin">1. Ioh. 5.17.</note>
                        <hi>There is a sinne not vnto death.</hi> But his meaning is not, that any sinne is of it selfe veniall; but that some sinnes God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueth,<note place="margin">Mat. 12.31.32.</note> and some he neuer forgiueth: namely, <hi>The sin against the holy Ghost.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, by this figment of Purgatorie they make Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandise of Christs Priesthood, while they sell Pardons and Masses for the redemption of soules, out of the imaginary <hi>Cocytus</hi> of their owne inuention: and grant full, fuller, and most full pardons, euen as your money will stretch vnto.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, they lift vp themselues herein aboue all the power of Christ. For they say, Christ onely hath remitted the guilt: but the <hi>Pope in his Pardons doth remit guilt and punishment:</hi> yea, that <hi>he hath power to remit the paines of Hell also.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To conclude, if we shall answere a foole according to his foolishnesse, it is euident, that if there be any Purgatorie, yet there is none therein tormented. For <hi>Euery Masse</hi> (say they) <hi>deliuereth a soule from Purgatorie:</hi> but there are many more Masses sung, then there are Catholike soules departed.</p>
                     <p>Againe, if Almes, if Pardons can deliuer soules from Purgatorie, why doe not the Monkes and Friers sell their fat Abbeyes, and Lordly Priories to procure Pardons from the Romish Sea, vnto all those poore imprisoned soules, which cannot helpe themselues?</p>
                     <p>Lastly, what a toy is it, to see the purple Fathers, and My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred Bishops of the Latine Church, from their great Lord the Pope promulge pardons of <hi>Three thousand yeares, fiue thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand yeares, thirtie thousand yeares,</hi> 100000. <hi>yeares,</hi> to the soules in Purgatorie, and yet the best of them agree, that after the resurrection there is no Purgatorie?<note place="margin">1.

                     <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>Hen it first came into my thoughts to offer vnto your Grace, most Reuerend Father, the second part of these my labours, I found not a little consternation of minde, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict of opinion in my selfe, considering your exquisite learning, and the grauity of your iudgement: it caused me oftentimes to take my hand from the paper, as abashed to offer these rude and vnpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lisht lines vnto your patronage. But on the other side, when I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the singular clemency and gracious disposition which in the whole course of your gouernement hath so abundantly decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red it selfe, I was animated and encouraged to present the poore fruits of an vnlearned pen vnto you, not without assured hope to
<pb facs="tcp:2645:205"/> finde fauour in your sight, since true honour is alwaies gracious, and the greatest learning hath most facilitie.</p>
                  <p>I know not what conceit sowre and suspicious hearts will haue of my trauailes, neither after what manner the sharpe swords which are in the mouthes of the popish Emissaries will entertaine me: but surely neither hatred of the persons of them of the Romish Church, nor any other sinister motion of minde (I trust) but onely the desire of the saluation of their soules whose simplicitie is led astray by the deceits of Antichrist, hath stirred me vnto the per<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>formance of this duty. For when should dogs awake the houshould, but at what time it is compassed about with theeues? Or when is it so fit to lift vp our voices in the Church, as when the Hereticks and false teachers labour most earnestly to set vp the abominable desolation? which certainly in these our daies they more busily and earnestly practise to effect, then euer they did since reformation of religion in the Church was first begunne.</p>
                  <p>And here, if I might be bold humbly and reuerently to shew vnto a great part of the Ministers of our Church their blemish, as <hi>Dauid</hi> shewed vnto <hi>Saul</hi> the cruse of water, and the Speare that stood at his head, I would presume to say, that euen by the fault of the Candles themselues the Watchmen and Shepheards of the flocke, the darknesse spreadeth it selfe euery day more and more ouer the whole house of God, and the Wolues haue free accesse vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fouldes of Christ: For surely vnto two sorts of Clergy men may this euill be chiefely imputed.</p>
                  <p>The first are they who neglecting to stand vp in the breach for the house of Israel, and to make warre against the Beast, spend all their ministerie in digladiation <hi>de lana Caprina,</hi> fighting about the shining of the Moone in the water: all their labour and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uour is nothing else but to declaime against the gouernement and the discipline of the Church. With their owne hands they bulge the ship that beareth them, and breake downe the walles of the
<pb facs="tcp:2645:205"/> house wherein they dwell, and become <hi>spiculatores pro spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culatoribus,</hi> and <hi>pro dispensatoribus dissipatores.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Author. Ser. ad frat. in eremo.</note> A mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serable thing it is that by their contentions and Schisme, Heresie should take oportunitie, and the kingdome of darknesse encrease amongst vs: in this vnhappy ataxy what remaineth? but with the Patriarch to pray,<note place="margin">Gen. 9.27.</note>

                  <p>The second sort is of them who though they approue the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernement and consent vnto the discipline of our Church; yet whether they feare to displease the few of <hi>Babylons</hi> great Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants which are left amongst vs; or whether they mis-doubt the stabilitie of times, I know not: but howsoeuer in all Morall arguments they lift vp their voices like Trumpets, yet in the cause and controuersies of Religion they are mute;<note place="margin">Iud. 5.23.</note> like the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>Meros</hi> they come not forth to help the Lord, against the mighty.</p>

                  <p>Euill must be alwaies resisted, and false doctrine as carefully quenched, as fire when it burneth houses, or the pestilence which infecteth the Citie. Wherefore not onely the Prophets, and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stles, and all holy men which spake by the Spirit of God, were directed to cry out against the wickednesse of their time, but in all ages the Fathers of the Church haue applied themselues to withstand the Heresies which sprung vp in their daies. <hi>Iraeneus</hi> laboured against <hi>Valentine</hi> and <hi>Marcion, Athanasius</hi> against <hi>Arians, Augustine</hi> against <hi>Donatists, Pelagians, Priscillia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> and <hi>Manichees, Leo</hi> against <hi>Eutiches, Eusebius Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roleus</hi> against <hi>Nestorius, Iohn</hi> Bishop of <hi>Constantinople</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Nouatus, Theodorus</hi> Bishop of <hi>Antioch</hi> against the <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polinarists, Rutherius Veronensis</hi> against the <hi>Anthropo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morphits.</hi> The time would faile mee to rehearse all that haue op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed themselues against spirituall wickednes in heauenly things; in euery age the worthy Fathers of the Church thought it their duty to root out of the field of Christ the seed of Satanicall and peruerse doctrine dispersed.</p>
                  <p>I trust therefore no man will maruell that I, a very worme
<pb facs="tcp:2645:206"/> of the earth, a man of obscure place, and meane gifts, haue put my selfe into the battaile against this huge and pestilent moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, the Whoore that sitteth vpon many waters: For though I consesse this argument requireth the pen of a ready writer, and skilfull artist to handle it; yet who is so ignorant but can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate that the Sunne shineth when the day is bright, that the water is moist, the fire hote, the earth by nature heauy? There are some things so manifest that a very child may proue them; and of such sort I haue alwaies esteemed the Idolatrie, Superstition, Heresie, falshood of the Romish Missals to bee. Wherefore since to the opening of their impietie, there rather nee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded faithfulnesse, then learning, and much labour then great knowledge, I presumed to take the worke in hand: like the poore and simple Christian,<note place="margin">Zozom. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>17.</hi>
                     </note> of whom <hi>Zozomen</hi> witnesseth that he stood vp against the curious and subtill Philosopher in a great Councell, and euen with simplicitie of Christian faith beat down the <hi>Goliah</hi> of heathenish and prophane Idolatry. Neither doe I feare to maintaine my propositions, and to proue these blasphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies by me alledged, against any of the Romish brood, bee they neuer so fallacious and full of Sophistications, being prepared if God permit to yeeld a ready account of any thing that in this poore volume I charge them with.</p>
                  <p>To conclude, I am with all humilitie bold to present this poore Worke vnto your Grace, hoping assuredly that it shall find an honourable and faire acceptance with you, for that the cause is the Lords; and the dignity it is of our great Prophet Iesus Christ, which I desire to vindicate from the barbarous violence, and treacherous hands of the Romish Antichrist.

But, of a more excellent lustre, of light more diuine, which poureth light into the Starres: at whose presence the Sunne and Moone are darke, and without glorie, I am to speake; the light of lights, the true light,<note place="margin">Ioh. 1.</note> which lighteth all that come into the world: which is both the light and the life of all

Vouchsafe O fire diuine, O fountaine of clearest brightnesse, O fairest Starre of righteousnesse, to arise in my blinde and ignorant heart, that my darknesse may comprehend some little sparke of thine inestimable clearenesse, whereby I may intreate of this thy high office to the honour and praise of thy Name, and to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction and comfort of them who shall peruse these Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditations.</p>
                     <p>After GOD had created the Heauen and the earth, the masse and matter of the whole world, it was set in discom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable and heauy darknesse: so that, though it had being, it had not beauty, but was without forme and void. For what is beautifull, which cannot be seene? But God, who alwaies is glorious in accomplishing and perfecting his own worke, said,<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 1.</note> Let there be light; and this light being crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, he saw that it was good. After the same fashion, when in the death of Christ all things were made new againe, and the lost world was with another creation the second time for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the same Word, which made the creature anew (that the beauty of his worke might appeare) hath also adorned the same with comelinesse, and shed of his owne light into our hearts by the spirit of his prophesie, according to that which was long agoe forespoken;<note n="b" place="margin">Esay 60.1.</note>
                        <hi>Arise O Ierusalem, be bright, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is risen vpon thee: behold, darknesse shall couer the earth, and grosse dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse the people, but the Lord shall arise vpon thee, and his glory shall be seene vpon thee, and the Gentiles shall walke in thy light, and Kings at the brightnesse of thy rising vp.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>His death is our life, and his suffering our new birth: But to be borne blinde, alas, it were to little purpose. For to none is Christs death auaileable, but to them who looke vpon it with the eye of faith, and haue knowledge to apply this all-healing medicine to their wounds.

                     <p>I may then, by so many Testimonies of Scripture vvar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted, inferre this vndoubted conclusion; That as Christ is our Priest by redeeming his Church: so it was necessarie that hee should bee our Prophet, to lead vs into the trueth: whose light directeth in the darknes, comforteth in the troubles of this our Pilgrimage, till we come to the new Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,<note n="n" place="margin">Apoc. 22.5.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Whoso now acknowledgeth that Christ is their Priest and hath redeemed them, must also confesse, that he is their
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:2645:209"/> Prophet and instructeth them. For the Apostle saith,<note n="o" place="margin">1. Cor. 1.30.</note> not onely that hee is made our Redemption, and Iustification, and our Sanctification of God, but our wisedome also: so that, if thou acknowledge Christ to be thy Saluation, thou must also take him to be thy wisedome: thou must follow him as thy guide: thou must hearken to him as thy teacher: learne him as the onely knowledge, by which we approche vnto God. Christ the Priest died for them onely, who em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Christ the Prophet, as their truth, their wisedome, their light. Doe not thinke, Christ the Priest wil confesse thy name before his Father, if Christ the Prophet deny thee to bee one of them who would be learned by him.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas of Prophets there be diuers kindes:<note n="p" place="margin">Vid.

Christ though he needed not any externall mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and second subordinate meanes of prophesie, yet hee vsed them sometimes, being a Prophet ministeriall in his humanitie, as in his diuine nature hee is the fountaine of Prophesie.</p>
                     <p>To conclude, Christ being God and Man, the engraued forme of his person, the very word of the Father, hath deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uered his prophesie immediately from God, as hee heard of the Father, and wrought with the Father: Angels, Cherubs, Visions, Dreames, Voices, Clouds, hee needed not to bee his Mediatours.

                     <p>If any man doubt, why the Sonne of God should rather haue this office then the Father or the holy Ghost, let him know, that it was meeter the Son should be called the word, then that the Father should be called the word, for the word is from God:<note place="margin">Vid.

                        <hi>CHAP. III.</hi> That our great Prophet, <hi>IESVS CHRIST,</hi> hath deliuered all things needfull to eternall life, in the booke of his Prophesy, the Canonicall Scripture.</head>
                     <p>HAuing proued that Christ is the ONLY Lampe and brightnesse, which can enlighten the Church: the ON<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY Shepheard and Prophet, which can instruct the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; it remaineth now to consider, whether hee hath left in his sacred Oracles so much knowledge, as may suffice to the full illumination, and perfect erudition of his flocke. And surely sundry arguments, and plentifull proofes there are, by which it may be cleerely manifest, that the Cononical Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are an infallible path, a perfect rule, an vndoubted guide, a Lantherne most cleare, a full definition of all things requisite to bee beleeued or done, of them that desire to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Citizens of the glorious <hi>Ierusalem</hi> which is aboue.</p>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>1</label> The first argument is taken from the excellency of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: for of the Scripture there is no other cause nor spring but the highest God. Hee that made all things of nothing, who in the wondrous volume, and spacious booke of the v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niuersall world, hath in such faire letters of glorie exprest his power, his wisedome, and his goodnesse, is the only Dicta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the Scriptures: the written word is from the begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten word,<note n="a" place="margin">Iob. 28.28.29</note>
                        <hi>Who is the Father of the rayne: who hath begotten the drops of the deaw; cut of whose wombe comes the yce: who hath engendered the frost of the heauen;</hi> out of this mind is this word proceeded. I confesse, mortall men were the pennes of this ready writer; but the water of the fountaine taketh nothing from the Conduit, thorow which it runneth; nor the light from the ayre thorow which it shineth: Neither did any of the Scribes of the holy Ghost intermingle ought of their owne.<note n="b" place="margin">1.

Pet. 1.16.</note> of any priuate motion what they did set downe: they followed not deceiueable fables, when they opened to vs the comming of our Lord Iesus. The Apostle therefore calleth
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:2645:213"/> the word of God<note n="d" place="margin">1. Pet. 1.23.</note>
                        <hi>Immortall Seede.</hi> Now then, if from a perfect cause there cannot be an vnperfect effect (but how much euery cause is more excellent, so much more is his worke excellent) they vniustly blaspheme the Scripture, that deny it to bee the abundant treasure of all heauenly know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge needfull vnto the Church. <hi>Moses</hi> shall reproue them; for hee sayth,<note n="e" place="margin">Deut. 32.4.</note>
                        <hi>Perfect is the worke of the mighty God.</hi> The Psalmist shall reproue them; for he sayth, that the perfection of the word of God is aboue all perfection;<note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 119 96.</note>
                        <hi>I haue seene the end of all perfection, but thy Commandement is exceeding large.</hi> Yea, the Lord himselfe reprooueth them;<note n="g" place="margin">Iob 40.3.</note>
                        <hi>Wilt thou disan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>null my iudgement? or wilt thou condemne me, that thou mayest be iustified?</hi> Well fayth the Schooleman therfore,<note n="h" place="margin">Alexand.

                     <p>The second argument let vs take from the end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>2</label> for which the word was ordained. <hi>Iohn</hi> sayth,<note n="i" place="margin">Io. 20.31.</note>
                        <hi>The Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell is written, that wee might beleeue, and in beleeuing haue euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting life.</hi> So, two ends he maketh thereof: Faith the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate: Eternall life the finall end of Scriptures. It is also called<note n="k" place="margin">Eph. 1.13.</note>

                        <hi>Blessed are they that keepe his Testimonies.</hi> So that of the Scriptures, blessednesse is the scope with <hi>Dauid.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> sheweth, that the end of Scriptures is;<note n="o" place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16.17. Pro. 3.4.</note>

                        <hi>The purpose of the preaching of the Gospell is, that we might be condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, according to men in the flesh, and we might liue according to God in the spirit.</hi> God himselfe calleth it, <hi>The word of his Couenant:</hi> then must it needes containe all that his Couenant doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire; Euangelists, Apostles, Prophets, Wisemen, Angells, yea, God himselfe vvitnessing, that the end and purpose for which the vvord was deliuered, is truth, faith, life, reconcili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, perfection vnto all good vvorkes.

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Argum. </seg>3</label> A third reason ariseth from a sufficient distribution, or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uision of the things that to saluation are needfull. And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, to instruct vs herein, foure things are necessary to bee knowne from vvhom we are; vvhat we are; to what end we are: and how this end must bee obtained: but all these things the Scripture doth fully comprehend; therefore it hath in it all that is to be knowne vnto Saluation. Others otherwise distribute, &amp; say, the things necessary to be known, are either concerning the essence &amp; the persons of the Trine Vnity, the supreme Maiesty of God; and those the Scripture, either explicitly in open words, or implicitly by necessity of conclusion, doth sufficiently deliuer: or else they concerne the creation of all things, and their preseruation, the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of sinne, the remedy against sinne, the inward grace, the outward instruments, the finall iudgement. In these things consisteth all that concerning saluation may be knowne: but all these are set out in the Scriptures; therefore Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures containe <hi>Omne scibile,</hi> all that can be knowne vnto sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation.</p>
                     <p>If there were nothing else, the very Gospell it selfe by the iudgement of <hi>Aquinas,</hi> containes wisedome enough to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struct vs vnto Saluation. For the new Testament is diuided into the Euangelicall, and Apostolicall writings. The Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall describe the head, and the offices thereof, which is Christ:<note place="margin">Vid. Tho.

But more cannot bee deliuered concerning the Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:2645:214"/> man, then the head and the body: the beginning, the middle, and the end: therefore all that is needefull to sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, is contained in the Gospell; and the Apostle might iustly say, that<note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 1.16.</note>
                        <hi>it is the power of God vnto saluation, to euery one that beleeueth.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>There are that distinguish, and say, the holy Scripture con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning God sheweth vs the Sonne in the Father, and the Father in the Sonne, and the holy Ghost from them both: and this is as much as can bee knowne concerning God: it teacheth man what helpeth, and what saueth:<note place="margin">Quod inuat, &amp; quod saluat. Isicht<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us. in <hi>6.</hi> Leuit.</note> what is come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and what is necessarie; therefore it deliuereth vs as much as is needfull to be knowne vnto saluation concerning Man.</p>
                     <p>Another diuideth the Scripture into the Historie, the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesie, and holy writings. The History declareth things past: the Prophesie things to come: the <hi>Hagiographa,</hi> or holy writings, doe order the present conuersation,<note place="margin">Simile habet Hono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius in Prolog.

                     <p>Some say, that according to the three <hi>Theologicall</hi> vertues, the Scripture is ordained and disposed; <hi>Faith, Hope,</hi> and <hi>Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie:</hi> But in these consisteth all the completure of a Christian man;<note place="margin">Rupertus de pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess. spir. Sanc. c. <hi>13.</hi>
                        </note> therfore in the Scripture al to a Christian man required is deliuered.</p>
                     <p>All Meditations are of three sorts; one consisteth in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sideration of our owne manners:<note place="margin">Potho. l. <hi>2.</hi> de stat. domini dei. ex Cōt. <hi>1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        </note> a second in contemplation of Gods law ordained: the third in contemplation of the workes of God. Our manners are either good or euill: his lawes either commanding, promising, or threatning: His workes threefold; what he hath made by his power: how he gouerneth by his wisedome: how he saueth by his grace. These are all the things mans soule can meditate vpon: But all these are handled in the Scripture; therefore all is in Scripture deliuered that the thoughts of Man can worke vpon.</p>
                     <p>All that wee ought to doe, is comprehended in the ten Commandements: all that we ought to beleeue, is contained in the Creede: all that we ought to pray for, is contained in the Lords Prayer: But all these are found in the Scripture,
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:2645:215"/> taken out of the Scripture, taught in the Scripture; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all that we ought to doe, to beleeue, to desire, is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, we may not omit the Apostle <hi>Pauls</hi> distribution, who vnto <hi>Timothy</hi> saith, that<note n="r" place="margin">2. Tim. 3.16.</note>
                        <hi>All Scripture is giuen by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spiration of God: and is profitable to teach, to improue, to correct, and to instruct in righteousnesse.</hi> And surely, nothing more can be required in any teacher, vnto the perfection of doctrine.</p>

The first, that Gods word contai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth not all things sufficient to saluation; Secondly, the want which is in the Scripture, is supplyed by traditions, which are of equall power with the Scriptures: Thirdly, it must be beleeued, that all the Romish Traditions are Aposto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licall, from the mouth of Christ, from the Spirit of God, from the infancy of the Church: Lastly, if any man doubt hereof, the Pope is sole Iudge, and hath power to declare Traditions to be Apostolicall: and if they are not, by his absolute power to make them such. And now (christian Reader) I appeale to thy conscience, what may they not say? what may they not do? what may they not bring in, whose authoritie is so large, and whose power is so indefinite?</p>

                     <p>Others also corrupted the Hymns &amp; prayers of the church: <hi>Wee praise thee O God: blessed bee the Lord God of Israel:</hi> and turned them into <hi>We praise thee Lady, and blessed be the Lady:</hi> yea, the <hi>Creede</hi> of <hi>Athanasius</hi> they peruerted; <hi>Whosoeuer will be saued, it is necessary that hee hold the faith concerning our Lady.</hi>

                     <p>First, touching the conception of Iesus Christ, with a foo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish Dialogue they come to the Virgin; as though Christ were anew to be conceiued;<note n="a" place="margin">Suscipe verbum virgo Maria, quod tibi à domino per angelum transmis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sum est; concipies per aurem, deum paries &amp; homi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nem.

I know, the manner how the Virgin conceiued is ineffable, neither can they vtter it, which the very Angels haue not wisedome to expresse. But certaine it is, Christ was there conceiued, where he tooke his flesh, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen in the wombe of the holy Virgin: and of her sanctified and purified seede, the purer part of her bloud, did Christ take flesh by the wondrous operation of the Holy Ghost. The Romane Breuiarie is ashamed of these absurdities, and leaueth out in this Responsory the words, <hi>Per aurem,</hi> by the eare. And this not without good cause haue they done, lest there should bee warres of ignorance, and fiction against fiction.

                        <hi>CHAP. XX.</hi> Of the superstition of the Romish Church in their Diuine worship.</head>
                     <p>SVperstition is an opposite vnto true Religion, either gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing diuine worship vnto things, to which it is not due; and then it is called Idolatry: or else worshipping God after such manner as he hath not ordained; and then it is called
<pb n="429" facs="tcp:2645:249"/> will-worship, putting Religion in such things, wherein it should not be put. And of this kind I am now to entreate.</p>
                     <p>Of all the particular examples, which the Romish Church doth administer vnto vs in this kind, I purpose not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course;<note n="a" place="margin">Ex noua Leg.

Lomb.</note>
                        <hi>Macarius,</hi> who because he had killed a flye, did penance sixe Moneths naked in the wildernesse, tearing wilfully his whole body with thornes:<note place="margin">Ibid. in vita Fran.</note> * or how Saint <hi>Francis</hi> would not touch the Candle, lest his fingers should infect it: or how he did al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waies tread with reuerence vpon the Rocke,<note place="margin">Pet. the Apostle.</note> in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of him who was surnamed the Rocke: Or how he would gather wormes out of the high way, and gently lay them aside, lest trauellers should tread on them.</p>
                     <p>Infinite are the examples, which Monkery of this kind affordeth. My purpose is onely to shew, that their Missals and publique worship is a shop of superstition, and insteed of the true and holy worship of God, teacheth men to place religion, in vaine, and superstitious obseruations, Of this kind is that cautell touching the saying of Collects,<note n="c" place="margin">In caut.

                        <hi>Corinthians,</hi> that they walked not in crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, neither handled the word of God deceitfully: but in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration of the truth they approue themselues to euery mans conscience in the sight of God. And indeed of the Ministers of Iesus Christ it is the greatest praise, in simplicity of al truth and holinesse to seeke the edification of the flocke commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them. But to mocke, when they should feed, and to play the iuglers, setting <hi>Tantalian</hi> feasts before the people, which none can touch, none can tast, nor put into his mouth: and yet to bid them go to, and eat, and drinke, is Satanicall and diuelish imposture. Yet this is the guise of the <hi>Romish</hi> Sheepheards, who call vpon the people to heare, to hearken, to consider, to remember, to lay vp in their hearts, when all the while their doctrine is like the feast, which the Crane made vnto the Fox in a pot of a narrow mouth, whereof, be he neuer so crafty, he cannot tast.</p>
                     <p>In reading the passion of Christ they distinguish<note n="b" place="margin">Miss. sec. vsum Sar. dominic. in ramis.

O notable mockery! What needs this distinction of voices? this notati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of words? these sundry tunes to make an idle noise, which no man vnderstandeth?</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXII.</hi> The blasphemous violence, which the Romish Church offereth to our great Prophet Iesus Christ, by forbidding what hee commandeth, and commanding what hee forbiddeth, and dispensing with his precepts.</head>
                     <p>OF the great Aduersary of Iesus Christ, the Prophet <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel</hi> doth foreshew, that<note n="a" place="margin">Dan. 9 26.27.</note>
                        <hi>The abomination of desolation shall destroy the Citie and the Sanctuary:</hi> And our Sauiour saith,<note n="b" place="margin">Math. 24.15.</note>
                        <hi>It shall stand in the holy place.</hi> And the Apostle <hi>Paul,</hi>

                        <hi>He is an aduersarie, and exalteth himselfe against all that is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led God, or that is worshipped: so that he doth sit as God in the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of God, shewing himselfe that he is God.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Now this cannot be better vnderstood then of the chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the lawes and ordinances of God, exauctorating of his precepts, repealing of his iudgements, and placing their owne decrees insteede thereof. This is to shew himselfe a God, though he call not himselfe a God. Wherfore the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple vvherein Antichrist shall sit, some not vnaptly haue said to be the holy Scriptures: for that Antichrist taketh autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritie ouer them, and raigneth as it vvere in them, taking to himselfe power to change, and leaue out: to adde vnto it what pleaseth him. Hereof in the Romish Church wee haue examples ouer plentifull. In all their Catechismes, and edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ten Commandements, because they see the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond commandement is a strong witnesse out of the mouth of God himselfe against idolatry, therefore they vtterly leaue it out: and to fill vp the number of the words of God, they diuide one Commandement into two. But hereof God vvilling in the Chapters following I vvill more fully dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course.</p>

                        <hi>Luke</hi> hauing deliuered the institution of Christ touching the first part of the Sacrament, <hi>viz.</hi> the bread, saith;<note n="k" place="margin">Luke 12.20.</note>
                        <hi>Simi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liter, Likewise he took the Cup:</hi> noting therby, that w<seg rend="sup">th</seg> the same authoritie, the same commandement, the same power, Christ ordain'd the receiuing of the Cup, as of the bread. S. <hi>Mathew</hi> proceeds further, &amp; shews an absolute iniunction to all, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue the cup. For though whē he deliuered the bread, he said; <hi>Take, eate, this is my body:</hi> yet when he came to the Cup, fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowing, no doubt, the violence &amp; iniurious abuse, w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> the Synagogue of Satan should offer vnto this blessed Sacramēt, that he might establish his Church for euer in the right ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seruation of his institution, and arme them before against this incursion, he saith not simply, as before; <hi>Take</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">Mat. 26, 27.</note>
                        <hi>eate:</hi> but <hi>drinke ye all of it.</hi> So that, if wee should insist vpon the
<pb n="438" facs="tcp:2645:254"/> outward letter, wee may reasonably say, that all are more precisely and literally bound to the receiuing of the Cup, then of the Bread. For of the Cup hee said; <hi>Drinke all of it:</hi> of the Bread he onely said, <hi>Take and eate.</hi> But the truth is, that the receiuing both of the bread and wine are by Christs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitution necessarie. The Apostle confirmeth the same. For first, speaking of the institution he saith;<note n="m" place="margin">1. Cor. 11.25</note>
                        <hi>After the same manner also when hee had supped, hee tooke the Cup,</hi> and commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the reuerent receiuing of the Cup to the people, hee saith; <hi>Let a man therefore examine himselfe, and so let him eate of this bread, and drinke of this cup.</hi> And in the six and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tith verse hee sheweth,<note n="n" place="margin">Ibid.</note> that this institution of receiuing the wine must continue in the Church till the appearing of Christ. For he saith; <hi>As often as yee shall eate this bread, and drinke this cup, ye shew the Lords death till he come.</hi> Now these words <hi>(Till he come)</hi> what do they teach, but that the vse of the Bread, and of the Cup ought still to continue in the Eucha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rist, till IESVS CHRIST appeare againe in his glory? euen as hee himselfe hath commanded, <hi>Doe this in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In all these things appeareth the impudencie of the Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let strumpet, vvho curseth bitterly, and sheddeth the bloud of the sheepefold of Christ vnmercifully, for receiuing and beleeuing the very voice of the true Shepheard himselfe: which the Euangelists most carefully, and with words ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acting obedience haue set downe. Insomuch that her contu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macie can neuer be excused, though the old Serpent him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe vse all his wiles, and summon all his Arts together to extenuate the same.</p>
                     <p>Hereto let vs adde the <hi>Vow of Chastitie,</hi> imposed vpon vveake men and vvomen, contrarie to the doctrine of the Apostle: the cause of many temptations: the occasion of many filthy and forbidden lusts. The prohibiting of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage in the degreees of consanguinitie, vvhich in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are not forbidden; As betwixt the God-father and God-mother, or those, betwixt whom the Font-stone (as

                     <p>Let vs adde also the dispensations of the Pope to marry in degrees prohibited; such as hee granted to <hi>Henry</hi> the eight, to marry with his owne brothers wife: And to <hi>Philip</hi> the second, King of <hi>Spaine,</hi> to marry with his owne sisters daughter, expressely against the word of God and the Scriptures of saluation.

                     <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> precisely ordaineth,<note n="p" place="margin">1.

                     <p>The impudent separation of Man and Wife, vvhen out of blinded deuotion they agree to enter into religious or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, as also vpon other causes besides Adulterie and Forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, none can defend, beeing against the expresse com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandement of God, and the institution of Matrimonie.</p>
                     <p>Against the institution it is, to diuorce for any other cause then for wedlocke-breaking. For GOD himselfe saith;<note n="q" place="margin">Gen. 2.18.</note>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> Of the Idolatry of the Romish Church: what an Image is? whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>there be any difference betwixt an Image, and an Idoll? what the worship and adoration of an Image is?</head>
                     <p>THe makers of Images had sundry ends for which they formed the same. Some ordained Images to be memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials and representations of such as they loued and honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red: others for lucre and gaine became makers of Images and Pictures: some made them for ornament, and to decke their houses: some also set them vp for oblectation and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, being pleased with the finenesse of the skill, and the liuelinesse of the Art. Yea, the making of Images seemeth to be an imitation of God himselfe: For whereas God hath created all things of nothing, Man though he could not so do, thought yet to imitate his Creator, as farre as he might, and by production to resemble creation, making the like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, when he could not make the substance, and forming or fashioning one matter out of another: for out of nothing he could not do it.</p>
                     <p>An Image then is the forming or fashioning of any like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse, either for imitation, loue, reuerence, ornament, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, or what cause else soeuer the maker thereof proposeth to himselfe. And it is in Hebrew called <hi>Temuna, Tselim,</hi> and some say, <hi>Teraphim:</hi> Which words signifie formes or Images.<note n="a" place="margin">Ʋid. Pet. Mart. de <hi>2.</hi> praecept. in princip. tract.</note> Now the Greeke word <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> (as <hi>Tertullian</hi> well obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth) comes <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, which is as much as <hi>Species</hi> in Latine, or a fashion or resemblance in English. In Latine the word is <hi>Simulachrum,</hi> a similitude or likenesse: And it is deriued of the Latine word <hi>Simulo,</hi> which is as much as to faigne, to lye, or to counterfeit. And surely the<note n="b" place="margin">Vid. Lact. lib. in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stit. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>19.</hi> &amp; Plin. lib. <hi>34.</hi> cap. <hi>4.</hi> ex H.

                        </note> Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of God the Father, God the Sonne, and God the Holy Ghost, of the blessed Trinity, and glorious Vnity, are of all figments and lyes the most fallacious. Wherefore they are sinnes and euils against nature: they witnesse God to be fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, who is infinite: corporall, who is most spirituall, and
<pb n="445" facs="tcp:2645:257"/> of all other farthest remoued from a body: and that God doth consist of parts, who is the most simple Essence vndi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uided.</p>
                     <p>Therefore when they forme an image vnto God, they should say, such he is not, contrary to this, and not the like. God hath neither sex nor age; body nor parts; affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons within, nor colours without: He is that he is: and what he is, eye hath not seene, eare hath not heard, neither can the heart of man conceiue.</p>
                     <p>The matter of euery Image is earth, stone, wood, siluer, gold, metall, or the composition of these. The forme of an Image is a likenesse of that which the maker doth either see, heare, or imagine, and nothing else. He neither giues it life that formeth it, nor sense, nor motion, nor vnderstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, nor holinesse, nor power: but dead and dumb things are all Portraits whatsoeuer; as the Psalmist witnesseth;<note n="c" place="margin">Psal. 115.5.</note>
                        <hi>Mouthes haue they and speake not, eyes haue they, and see not, they haue eares and heare not, neither is there any breath in their nostrels.</hi> Wherefore <hi>Lactantius</hi> concludeth well, that<note n="d" place="margin">Lact. lib. <hi>2.</hi> iusti. cap. <hi>19.</hi>
                        </note> an Image cannot be a thing religious, because it is altogether earthly.<note n="e" place="margin">Vid. H. Bullinger de orig. error. c. <hi>29.</hi>
                        </note> The matter thereof is earthly, and the forme earthly, and he that made it, earth it selfe.<note n="f" place="margin">Sap. 15.16.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>Let vs now come to the question, whether an Idoll and an Image be all one? For the better discussing of which que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion, let vs first consider the beginning of Images.

But (as I haue said) whether it be part of the first commandement, or else the second precept it selfe, it is from God our maker: it is to vs his creatures: it is an euer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lasting couenant of Salt, which he hath made with his church for euer. And that wicked one is he, whosoeuer taketh vpon him to exauctorate and change this law of God.</p>
                     <p>In the second place let vs consider the words of the lawe, and the things which are prohibited therein. <hi>Thou shalt make thee no grauen image, neither any similitude of things that are in heauen, neither that are in the earth beneath, nor that are in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters vnder the earth: thou shalt not bow downe to them, neither serue them.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The first place named in this precept forbiddes the making
<pb n="452" facs="tcp:2645:261"/> of the image of God, of Angels, of heauenly powers, of those holy soules that are now with God: as also of the Sunne, the Moone, the Stars, the firmament, and all that is in the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous circle of heauen.</p>
                     <p>The second place named in the precept doth prohibite the likenesse of Man, Beasts, Birdes, Wormes and Serpents, Plants, Trees, Hearbes: and generally all that is in, or vpon the earth, to bee made, and to bee worshipped, or set vp in our Temples, or in our houses to bee feared, and religiously serued.</p>
                     <p>The third place in the precept doth forbidde the making &amp; worshipping of the similitude of any of the creatures, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther liuing or dead, within the vast womb of the sea, or which in any other water aboue, or vnder the earth are contained: it forbiddeth also the image of diuels and wicked spirits, and of all kind of infernall ghosts and satanicall powers to be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med and reuerenced. But since it seemeth a question of great difficulty, whether that the image of the holy, diuine, incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehensible essence it selfe may be made, or worshipped, wee will especially examine that point.</p>
                     <p>There is no doubt, but of all other things the likenesse may bee made, so it bee not worshipped: but of GOD the likenesse or image may not be made, though we do not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship it.</p>
                     <p>The first reason against the images of the essence of God is this. No man knoweth what the likenesse of God is; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no man can make a likenesse vnto him. The propositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is sufficiently proued. For <hi>Esay</hi> saith;<note n="w" place="margin">Esay 40.18</note>
                        <hi>To whom will ye liken God? or what similitude will ye set vp vnto him?</hi> Iesus Christ himselfe teacheth vs,<note n="x" place="margin">Io. 4.24.</note> that <hi>God is a spirit.</hi> Now of a spirit who can make any likenes? For it hath neither parts, nor shape. <hi>Iohn</hi> teacheth vs;<note n="y" place="margin">1. Io. 4.12</note>
                        <hi>No Man hath seene God at any time. Paul</hi> saith;<note n="z" place="margin">1 Tim. 6.16.</note>
                        <hi>He dwelleth in the light that none can attaine vnto: whom neuer man sawe, neither can see:</hi> But whereof wee cannot see the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, the picture wee cannot make. God then can by no similitudes bee expressed. This hath made the Papists after sundry manners in images to expresse the Trinity, whereof
<pb n="453" facs="tcp:2645:261"/> if one bee a true likenesse, the other must needs be false.</p>
                     <p>The second reason against the image of Gods essence is this; God is not onely inuisible, but also incomprehensible: the tongue cannot speake of him, the eare cannot heare of him, the heart cannot vnderstand of him as he is; Therefore of his incomprehensible essence there can be no image made. For the image doth import a determination, and description of the thing whose image it is: But God cannot be determined, or described;<note n="a" place="margin">Eph. 4.6. 1 Cor 8.6</note>
                        <hi>He is aboue all and in all:</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Ier. 23.24.</note>
                        <hi>hee filleth heauen and earth.</hi> Heauen is his seat, the earth is his footstoole. Nay, the heauen of heauens cannot containe him, yet they vvill measure him with an Idoll of an inch.</p>
                     <p>The third reason against the images of the Trinity, &amp; the essence of God, is the perill of idolatry.

                     <p>The fourth reason against the making of the images of God, is the continuall iudgement of the Church from the beginning, euen vnto this day. For it beeing an assured ground in religion that God is a spirit, all holy men haue euermore worshipped God, not in corporall figure, but with inward and spirituall acknowledgement. At the first indeede the Diuell had his Church, and as <hi>Abel</hi> did truely and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ously worship God: so <hi>Cain</hi> did the same hypocritically and falsly. And after the death of <hi>Abel,</hi> it seemeth, the <hi>Caynites</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerted all true worship, till the daies of <hi>Enos</hi> the sonne of <hi>Sheth.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Gen. 4.26.</note> For then (as <hi>Moses</hi> witnesseth) <hi>Men began to call vpon the Name of the Lord.</hi> And in this family of <hi>Sheth</hi> and <hi>Enos</hi> the true worship of the Lord continued without any ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges till the floud of <hi>Noah,</hi> when all the <hi>Caynits</hi> that generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the wicked murtherer were destroyed in the floud. After the floud, religion was preserued in the family of <hi>Noah,</hi> and the true worship was still, of God alone in Spirit, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any image or similitude, vntill the daies of <hi>Thare</hi> the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>Abraham,</hi> when about three hundred yeares after the floud, Idols found meanes againe to creepe into the place of worship. And this, <hi>Iosua</hi> noteth as a blemish in the Fathers of the house of <hi>Israel;</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Iosua 24.2.</note>
                        <hi>Your fathers dwelt beyond the floud in old time, euen</hi> Terah <hi>the father of</hi> Abraham, <hi>and the father of</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, <hi>and serued other gods.</hi> But <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob,</hi> and the Patriarchs reformed religion againe: amongst whom there was not an image. Nay, when as through his idolatrous wiues children and their attendants, the worship of God began in <hi>Iacobs</hi> house to be corrupted, he commandeth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently vnto his houshold, and all that were with him, to put away the strange Gods. Now if you desire to know what the strange Gods were, the thirty one chapter of <hi>Genesis</hi> sheweth,
<pb n="455" facs="tcp:2645:262"/> that<note n="h" place="margin">Gen. 31.30 &amp; 34.</note>
                        <hi>Rachel</hi> had taken her fathers Idols, and <hi>Laban</hi> calleth them his Gods. After this, God raised vp <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> to lead the people out of Egypt, and by the Ministerie of <hi>Moses</hi> the Law was giuen vnto them. This law prohibited all kinde of images for worship, and was so strictly and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uerely obserued, that all Idolaters and enticers to Idolatry were censured with death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iosuah,</hi> when he perceiued the abomination of Idols to be crept in amongst them, indured it not, but like a godly Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strate calleth vpon them, and sheweth that the worship of God and Idols could not stand together;<note n="i" place="margin">Ios. vlt. verse 22. &amp; 23.</note>

And indeede, whensoeuer the people fell to the worship of Idols, the Prophets alwaies cried out, and lifted vp their voices against it: and their continuall preaching so preuailed at last, that <hi>Origen</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Origen.</note> against <hi>Celsus</hi> doth vvitnesse; in the commonwealth of the Iewes there was no caruer, nor maker of Images or Statues, whom the law did not driue away, lest there should bee any occasion of making Images. And thus also continued religion without images during the gouernement of the <hi>Machabees,</hi> till the comming of Iesus Christ himselfe and his Apostles: of whom we doe not finde one that euer worshipped, or prayed before an image. But the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> of all image worshippers saith,<note n="l" place="margin">Ro. 1.22.23.</note>
                        <hi>When they professed themselues to be wise, they became fooles.

                     <p>The same beginning, the same progresse, had the images of the Christians. For, at the first in Christian Churches vvere neither images, nor pictures of God, or of his Saints. And if out of the custome of Gentiles such were made, the impietie by wholesome lawes and industry of godly Doctors was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently opposed; as wee see in the constitution of <hi>Valence</hi> and <hi>Theodosius,</hi> vvho prohibited all men to paint, or carue in co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours, in stone, or in any other matter, the image of our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiour Christ: and wheresoeuer pictures should bee found, they commanded them to bee taken away, chastising vvith most grieuous punishment, those that should resist their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees and commandements herein.</p>

                     <p>But, as amongst Pagans, so amongst Christians, in tract of time Images crept into the Church, not to be kneeled vnto, or to pray before them, or to be sought to in Pilgrimage: but to expresse the noble acts of famous Martyrs, and worthy teachers in the Church. Such was the Picture of <hi>Cassianus</hi> that famous Schoole-master, and Martyr, in the Temple of <hi>Forum Sempronij,</hi> full of wounds, with a thousand stripes ouer all his body, which were giuen vnto him by his owne Schollers, who were pictured cutting, launcing, and stab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the members of their Christian Maister with Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kniues and gaddes, by the permission of the persecuting Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant. Which picture <hi>Prudentius</hi> recordeth himselfe to haue beheld.</p>
                     <p>Such was the picture of Christ, which <hi>Tertullian</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>In the Images of the Heathen sometimes Sathan wrought to blinde the Priests, as<note n="e" place="margin">Lact. lib. instit. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>8.</hi>

                     <p>So in Popery also, some miracles are wrought at the Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of Saints by the diuell, to infatuate both Priest &amp; people; as when the Crucifix spake to <hi>Thomas Aquinas;</hi>

                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> also agrees vnto. Which though it be contained in the other three, yet for perspicuities sake wee will handle it seuerally. For the truth is, the Romish Church doth not obserue any of these limitations; they are onely nets of Sophistication: they are false and deceitfull bayts, painted Sepulchres, pits coue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red with rushes, in whom there is no truth nor integritie at all.</p>

                     <p>All these examples do plainly shew, that the wiser Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then did neuer place any trust in the Image it selfe, which they thus contemned and despised.

                     <p>It is manifest, that the Romish Church putteth trust and confidence in the very Image.

                     <p>A Great difference the Romish Synagogue maketh be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt her idols, &amp; the idols of the Heathē. For out of the Scripture they proue, that the Gentiles did verely worship &amp; esteeme their images as Gods, hauing diuinitie in themselues. This is proued euery where in the scripture, say they: In <hi>Exod.</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 32.1.</note> the people spake to <hi>Aaron, Vp make vs Gods to goe before vs,</hi> when they meant Images: and when they were made, they worshipped them, saying;<note n="b" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 4.</note>

                        <hi>They turned their glory into the similitude of a Bullocke that eateth grasse.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>These places vvith diuers others are so demonstratiue, that they irrefragably euince, the Heathen images to haue beene esteemed of them as gods and diuine powers.</p>
                     <p>Against the light of truth none may contend. The Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles did take their images to bee Gods, but it vvas onely, <gap reason="foreign">

They called them Gods, because they represented their gods vnto them: because their Gods by them, or through them, did giue Oracles and answeres, did grant their petitions, did vvorke wonders. Euen as a painted man, is called a man, though he is not beleeued to bee such: So an image is called God, though it bee knowne to bee a stocke: the Rites, the representation, the adoration giue name vnto it: not a proper name, but a borrowed name: not that the Heathens did verely account them such as they called them, but called them such as they esteemed those, to whom they vvere dedicate. I need not labour to proue this which the Scripture it selfe doth witnesse. The Herauld who

                        <hi>the Kings gods, and the Kings image also.</hi> By vvhich it doth appeare, that though they gaue the appellation of God vnto it, calling the signe by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pellation of the thing signified: yet in substance they estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med it an image.</p>

Out of this appeareth how <hi>Tully</hi> estee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med of images, and what vse the Heathens made of them in that time.</p>
                     <p>I haue recited <hi>Arnobius</hi> in the former Chapters, and here also his testimonie commeth in good season. For hee saith, the Gentiles adored Images; not that the gold, the brasse, the siluer, or any other matter, or substance of Images, are Gods: but because the presence of the gods (which otherwise is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uisible) is exhibited by an Image, and for that in them the Gods, or the power of the Gods doth dwell.</p>
                     <p>

                     <p>The summe of these things is, that the Romanists do not esteeme their Images as Gods: The Heathens did no other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise. Therefore the Papists vvorship Images as the Heathen did. The Heathens vnproperly called their Images Gods: so doth the Church of Rome also. For <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith,<note n="i" place="margin">Image est ipsum exemplar Analogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce, et secundū quid. Bell. de Imag. Sanc. lib. <hi>2.</hi> cap. <hi>25.</hi>

All these things are signes of diuine honour: but all these the Romanists doe vno their Images.

                        <hi>Carolus Sigonius</hi> a Bishop of the Popish Church calleth the gallowes, on which <hi>Iosuah</hi> hanged the kings of <hi>Aye,</hi> a Cross: and saith, the greeke interpreter renders it, <hi>geminum lignum,</hi> a double wood. But whether this double wood were a Crosse, as Papists picture it, or a Forke, they declare not at all. In this digladiatiō &amp; doubtfulnes of opinions, wherein writers agree not what was the figure of the Crosse, how can any <hi>Romanist</hi> tell, whether they worship the right signe, or not? And sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to worship that which is not the true signe of the Crosse of Christ, is plaine idolatry; because his body touched no such, nor died on no such, but on one perhaps of a far differēt kind.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>Romish</hi> Synagogue frameth Crosses differing from all these in proportion, making the shaft like a Sheepheards
<pb n="500" facs="tcp:2645:288"/> crooke in the toppe, to expresse the letter <hi>P.</hi> but so was not Christs Crosse, nor any other that we read of. Then they put two little peeces to the fashion of Saint <hi>Andrews</hi> Crosse. <hi>X.</hi> so that by abbreuiation the two letters signifie the whole name of Christ. They put then a transuerse piece, vpon which doth hang ouer the whole breadth a flagge or a veile. The shaft of their Crosse hath for the fitnes of carriage, an hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stall to beare the same withall, according to this figure.</p>

                        </figure>But the Crosse which Christ died on was not so. Wherefore the Crosse after the <hi>Romish</hi> edition, &amp; with the accoutremēt they ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to adde, is an idoll: a thing which neuer was; like the poets <hi>Centaurs,</hi> or the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians <hi>Serapis:</hi> and when they worship it thus, they are vnexcusable idolaters. For they worship the plain imagination of their own braines. But if any shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply that they worship not the shepherds crooke, the letters, the veile, the hand-stall: I then reioyn, they are yet wicked <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamites,</hi> which set snares and stumbling blockes before their brethren, and doe not withall teach, what is to bee worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, and what is not to be worshipped in their <hi>Hieroglyphical</hi> figment.</p>
                     <p>Hauing discoursed of the idolatry which the <hi>Romish</hi> church vseth toward the signe of the Crosse, yet one thing remaines wherein to satisfie the doubtfull reader.

<pb n="501" facs="tcp:2645:288"/> when they washed: when they ate: when they ligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted candles, christians in old time, did make the signe of the Crosse.</p>
                     <p>To all this I reply, first, that in the Primitiue infancy of the Church, God to magnifie his Sonne Iesus Christ, did worke great wonders and maruels, by the figure of the Crosse: but now because there is no need of miracles, (the whole world almost being brought vnto Christ) there is no such power in the signe of the Crosse, and where the vertue of the ceremony doth cease, the ceremony should also cease; as <hi>Ezechia</hi> brake in peeces the brazen Serpent, when hee saw it was honoured without vse.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, great was the reproche of the Crosse in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the Church. And vvhat greater contumely did the Heathens cast out against Christ, but that he vvas an han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged God, a crucified Sauiour?</p>
                     <p>Novv to shevv openly vnto the vvorld, that this extreme humiliation of our Sauiour, his shamefull death, his lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table bloudshedding, was the satisfaction vnto God for our sins, our victory ouer sin, death &amp; hell; therfore the old christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans euery where triumphed in the signe of the Crosse, prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sting that they were not ashamed of Christ crucified, <hi>who is the power of God vnto saluation.</hi> But now that this reproach of the Crosse is ceased, and the whole world almost glorieth in the comfortable name of Iesus, there is no need nor vse of the signe of the Crosse, to distinguish vs from Heathens, not to expresse the profit of the death of Christ. Euery tongue con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth that Christ is the Lord to the glory of God.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, although in respect of the Heathen the ancient christians did esteeme reuerently of the signe of the Cross: yet no man did giue diuine honour vnto it: no man did pray vnto it: no man did burne incense before it, nor offer Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice vnto it. Wherefore the reuerence which the ancient Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of the Primitiue Church gaue to the signe of the Cross, was not such, as the <hi>Romish</hi> Synagogue superstitiously &amp; wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedly ascribeth thereunto.</p>
                     <p>Mercifull God, the Father of our onely great and glorious
<pb n="502" facs="tcp:2645:289"/> euerlasting Prophet Iesus Christ, magnifie the name, and the office of thine only begotten Sonne: Let all harts know and feele, that he is the onely truth, the only way, the only light of all that come into this world, vnto eternal saluation. Grant vs grace therefore to follow him as our guide: to giue heed vnto him as our teacher: to abide in him as our life; that he may also confesse our names before thee, and acknowledge vs to be the plants of his garden, still nourished by his spirit, the sheep of his fould, which haue not hearkened to a stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers call.

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">Y</seg>Our Honour may perhaps demand of me, as once <hi>Antigonus</hi> the great Prince did of <hi>Bias a</hi> poore philosopher, <hi>Whence</hi> and <hi>Who?</hi> since vncouth and vnknowne I presume to present the harsh and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleasing lines of my rude labor vnto your patronage. To this, my Apologie is, If your Lordships facilitie had beene lesse, my presumption would not haue been so great: But now as the long wandring Pinnasse desireth to put into the fairest Hauen, and Souldiers euermore choose the most de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fensible shield: so I am bold with all humility to dedicate vnto your Honour these poore endeuours of mine against the common enemy; both in regard of your gracious disposition, as also your great autho itie: of which the one doth promise mee good ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and the other assured protection.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:2645:292"/>
                  <p>Surely if the blasphemie of the Romish Antichristian Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue were like vnto other Hereticks, whereof, one denieth the Manhood, as <hi>Ebion:</hi> another the Godhead as <hi>Arius:</hi> some the distinction of his Person from the Father, as <hi>Sabellius:</hi> others his humane soule, as <hi>Apolinaris,</hi> or the truth of his Pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, as <hi>Manicheus;</hi> The confutation of their impietie would be more easie: but confessing the natures, Papistry ouerthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the offices, not openly &amp; plainly as other Hereticks but crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and secretly. So that vnder the name of Christ, as <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, they confound the Religion of Christ; and as <hi>Tully</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porteth of <hi>Epicurus</hi> that he left gods vnto the people in words, but tooke them away in deeds: So the Romish schoole hath the forme of godlinesse, but denyeth the power therof. And though they outwardly confesse Christ, yet they spoile him of all the offices to which by the eternall counsell of God, for the repara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mankinde he is ordained. To this end therefore should all Ministers imploy their Studies, all States their Policy, all Magistrates their Power, all common-weales their Wisedome, that these Wolues disguised in Lambe-skins, these Messengers of Satan in the habite of Angels of light might bee vnmasked, and the mystery of iniquitie which walketh in the darknesse discouered to euery eye, and so all <hi>Israel</hi> should flee from <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and euery simple Sheepe vnderstand the collusion of the Foxes.</p>
                  <p>Of the Priestly and Propheticall parts in the former bookes I haue entreated; in this I shew what violence, what treachery they vse toward the supreme King of Kings and Lord of Lords; and withall against worldly Potentates and Princes, whom God hath ordained to be his Vice-gerents, and vnder him to exercise power in the earth.</p>
                  <p>Vnto your worthinesse therefore I offer this last Booke, wherein according to the talent giuen vnto me, I defend the
<pb facs="tcp:2645:292"/> dignitie and maiestie of the Regall power against the wicked vsurpation of the Romish Bishop. First, because I know how deere and precious vnto you the honour and dignity of our most Royall Soueraigne is: and secondly, if from your great wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome and learned censure these simple leaues shall receiue any approbation, I shall little regard the venimous aspersions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting tongues, or the poysoned teeth of any <hi>Zoylus</hi> what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer.</p>
                  <p>The Lord God of all power and might blesse your Honour in your high place of Iustice and of Gouernement so happily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gunne, that your brightnesse and your light may encrease more and more vntill the day be full; And at last as full of honours as of dayes you may be gathered to your Fathers in peace, and to the bosome of <hi>Abraham</hi> replenished with euerlasting ioy and glory: Which the Lord grant vnto you, thorow Iesus Christ our onely Mediatour and Aduocate.</p>

Wherefore, God being the Father, must needs haue God to be the Sonne: The Euerlasting beeing Father, the Euerlasting must bee the Sonne: The Father being King, the Sonne must be King al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so.

Yet heerehence wee must not inferre, that the will of the Saints, or of any of them, is a law vnto Gods will, or the rule of Gods will, or that there is any disposition of things in heauen or earth caused by the will of Saints.

                     <p>For the first point, the Acts of the Apostles speaketh much of the labours, preaching, miracles, imprisonment of <hi>Peter,</hi> and of his being at <hi>Ioppa,</hi> at <hi>Cesarea,</hi> at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and <hi>Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria:</hi> but of his being at <hi>Rome</hi> no word speakes Saint <hi>Luke,</hi> who yet was there himselfe.</p>
                     <p>From <hi>Rome</hi> the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> writeth sundry Epistles, wherein he rehearseth his fellow prisoners, and his fellow la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourers in the Gospell. Had <hi>Peter</hi> beene there, would he haue neglected such and so great an Apostle?

Now it is more charitie (the matter being doubtfull) to thinke that <hi>Peter</hi> was not at <hi>Rome,</hi> then that he assisted not the Apostle <hi>Paul.</hi> Nay, vnto <hi>Timothy</hi> he sheweth, that of the chief labourers som

If <hi>Luke</hi> onely were with him, <hi>Peter</hi> was not with him. But if at the time of writing the Epistle, <hi>Peter</hi> (as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> feigneth) were gone from <hi>Rome</hi> to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> why doth not <hi>Paul</hi> mention his departure, as well as the departure of others? Hereto may be added, that the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> writing<note n="k" place="margin">Rom. 16. <hi>per totum.</hi>
                        </note> from <hi>Corinth</hi> to <hi>Rome,</hi> saluted many priuate and common persons that had receiued the faith: But <hi>Peter</hi> the Prince of all the Church hee saluteth not. He<note n="l" place="margin">Acts <hi>vlt.</hi>
                        </note> disputeth also before the Iewes, as soone as hee came to <hi>Rome,</hi> concerning Iesus Christ, &amp; saluation through him: But of any preceding trauailes of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> at <hi>Rome,</hi> or any foundation of a Church there by him begun, <hi>Paul</hi> doth not make any mention.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> witnesseth, that<note n="m" place="margin">Gal. 1.9.</note> the charge <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Ratio </seg>4</label> of preaching the Gospell to the Gentiles, was by agreement committed to himselfe and <hi>Barnabas:</hi> but vnto the Iewes <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Iames</hi> and <hi>Iohn</hi> did preach.

                     <p>It remaineth now to shew how this Popish Empire is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posite vnto the Kingly office of Iesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>First, it is the Symbol and very badge of Antichrist, to call himselfe vniuersall Bishop, by the testimony of ancient Popes themselues.</p>

                        </note> that to agree vnto this wicked appellation (vniuersall Bishop) is nothing else but to lose our faith.

                     <p>The fulnesse therefore of this great power in the Pope, the Apostle maketh to bee a marke and signe of Antichrist. 2. <hi>Thess.</hi> 2. namely, that he shall sit in the Temple of God, that is, rule and gouerne in the Church of Christ, shewing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe as though he were God, dispensing, derogating, abro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gating, reseruing, releasing, absoluing, declaring, constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, prouiding, adnihilating, adnullating, reuersing, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prouing, confirming, and all at his pleasure, without rule, without law, without Canon, without controll.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is a great wrong vnto the Spirit of God to binde it to one Seate and one Person, as the Diuell was wont to be vnto the <hi>Tripodes</hi> of his <hi>Pythonesses:</hi> Whereas we know that<note n="o" place="margin">Ioh 3.8.</note> the spirit breatheth where it listeth.

                     <p>Thirdly, it is vnto the Kingly Office of Iesus Christ a
<pb n="540" facs="tcp:2645:314"/> great dishonour, to thinke, that except one visible head of the flocke be constituted on the earth, Christ cannot gouerne his Church by his word, and by his spirit.<note n="*" place="margin">Ephes. 4.7, 8.</note> Christ ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding vpon high, and now sitting at the right hand of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, hath giuen from time to time gifts vnto his owne body, which is the church: He stirreth vp Prophets, and Pastors, teachers and expounders of the word; so that we need not runne to <hi>Rome,</hi> or any other place for explication and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction of scriptures; since in euery place, and in euery Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ hath multiplied his gifts vpon many excellent Teachers, to the edifying of his church.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, to say that the Romish Bishop hath all lawes di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine and humane in the chest or closet of his brest, is blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemous violation of Christs Kingly Office, who hath on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly that power:<note place="margin">Apoc. 3.7.</note> to whom is committed the Key of <hi>Dauid,</hi> who shutteth and no man openeth: who onely is the wise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of the Father: the word which giueth lawes out of the bosome of the Father:<note place="margin">Esay 9.7.</note> The Law-giuer which sitteth vpon Throne of <hi>Dauid</hi> to stablish it with iudgement and with iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice.

                     <p>Fiftly, this Lordship of the Romish Bishop is altogether contrary to the doctrine of the Apostles. In the Primitiue Church <hi>Peter</hi> commandeth the Elders to feed the flock;<note place="margin">1. Pet. 5.3.</note>
                        <hi>Not as though yee were Lords ouer Gods heritage. Paul</hi> of himselfe and all the rest of Apostles saith;<note place="margin">2. Cor. 1.24. Ibid. cap. 10.4.</note>

                     <p>Sixtly, it is derogatorie to the dignity of Christ, to make <hi>Peter,</hi> or any successor of his, the foundation of the Church. For the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> doth witnesse;<note place="margin">1. Co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>THat there were sundry kindes of officers in the Church appointed by the Spirit of God and the Apostles of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ, according to the necessitie and occasion of the Church, there is no man so impudent as to deny. The Apostles when the multitude of beleeuers encreased euery day, so that themselues sufficed not to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pense the word and the Sacraments, and to distribute also the almes of the Church, did therefore chuse<note n="a" place="margin">Act. 6.2, 3, 4, 5.</note> seuen Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cons to minister to serue the tables, that they themselues might the better indure the worke of preaching, prayer, and gouernement of the flocke, vvithout let or disturbance. Of these Deacons, those which were approued in their cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, were taken to the office of teaching and preaching, as it is in <hi>Stephen</hi> and <hi>Philip</hi> to be seene. Wherefore in this infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour order of Ministers, it seemeth they were tried and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued who were fit to be admitted to the higher offices in the Church, according to that of the Apostle;<note n="b" place="margin">1.

                     <p>Other gifts and ministrations were also in the Church, as<note n="d" place="margin">Act. 13.1.</note> Prophets and Teachers. Of Prophets some foreshewed things to come, as <hi>Agabus,</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">&amp; 11.28. &amp; 21.9.</note> and the daughters of <hi>Philip,</hi> and diuers other: Some did<note n="*" place="margin">1 Cor. 14.27.</note> expound the hard and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult places of Scripture.

But to help also, no doubt, in the ministration of the Gospell.</p>
                     <p>In the Church of <hi>Ephesus</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">Ephes. 4.11.</note> there were Apostles, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Euangelists, Pastors, Doctors or Teachers, for the gathering together of the Saints: for the worke of the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisterie: and for the edification of the body of Christ.</p>
                     <p>The difference betwixt the ministrations is easily seene.</p>

                        <note place="margin">Euangelists and their office.</note>Of the Euangelists there were two kindes; Some that by writing deliuered the Acts and Historie of Iesus Christ, as <hi>Mathew, Marke, Luke,</hi> and <hi>Iohn:</hi> Another kinde of Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelists was sent from place to place for the preaching of the Gospell, and to lay the foundation of doctrine and religion. Such were<note n="l" place="margin">Act. 21. Ephes. 6, 21. 2. Thes. 1.1. Pastors and their office.</note>
                        <hi>Philip, Tichicus, Siluanus,</hi> and others. These were not Apostles, yet had they no particular charge, but went from church to church as necessitie required.</p>
                     <p>Pastors were set ouer particular churches, euery one in his charge: these were also called Elders, to whom <hi>Peter</hi> en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioineth,
<pb n="543" facs="tcp:2645:315"/> that they feed<note n="m" place="margin">1. Pet. 5.2.</note> the flocke committed to their charge. Of this kinde are all Rectors of seuerall parishes in our Church of England. We finde that these Pastors had su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periours or Bishops ouer them; such as <hi>Titus</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tit. 1.5.</note> was ouer them of <hi>Creet,</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Vnto Doctors the chiefe charge and superintendency ouer Churches was not committed:<note place="margin">Doctors and their office.</note> but yet they taught the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and laboured to instruct in their place. Into their roome the Catechists succeeded afterward; and these are in some sort resembled to the preachers in our daies, which assist the Pastors or Parsons of parishes in their charges. Of these also the Apostle seemeth to speake in his Epistle to the Hebrews;<note n="n" place="margin">Heb. 5.12.</note>
                        <hi>When as concerning the time ye ought to be teachers, yet haue ye need againe that we teach you.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In the Church of <hi>Corinth</hi> the Apostle saith there were di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersitie of administrations, and diuersitie of operations.<note place="margin">1.

Wherefore he saith,<note n="o" place="margin">1. Cor. 12.28.</note> there were Apostles, Prophets, Teachers: workers of miracles, they that had the gift of healing, helpers, gouernours, diuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitie of tongues. All these serued to the ministration of the word and of the Sacraments. But either all these churches had not the same number, nor kindes of offices, or else the gift of healing, helpers, gouernours, diuersitie of tongues, were not seuerall offices in the Church, but gifts and graces bestowed vpon the offices and orders of the Church by the spirit of God.

                     <p>DOore-keepers are instituted to the<note n="a" place="margin">1 Chron. 26.</note> imitation of the Iewish ceremonie, which ordained Porters for the Gates of the Temple. And if these bee holy orders, the Parish Clarke and Sexton are holy orders, to whom the keyes of their Cathedrall and Parish churches are commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: neither is there any vse of this order in their church in these daies, but onely that it may make vp the superstitious number. For this office is executed by boyes and mere babes. Of this office the ground is taken from the words of our Sauiour;<note n="b" place="margin">Ioh. 10.9. <hi>Pet.

                        <hi>I am the doore, by me if any man enter, he shall be saued.</hi> From hence they conclude, that the Doore-keeper is an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly office; as though the woodden church doore were Christ, or entring through the materiall gates were entring through Christ. I know, in the ancient church of GOD there were Doore-keepers, who kept the house of prayer, and did put out the excommunicate persons, Heathenish, Idolatrous,
<pb n="549" facs="tcp:2645:322"/> Hereticks, and such as were not perfectly instructed in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, when the holy mysteries were to be solemnized; but these were neuer accounted holy officers: neither vvere they reckoned amongst the orders and degrees of the church: they were mere humane ordinances, disciplinary seruices: corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, not spirituall, nor religious, nor for the edification of the body of Christ.</p>

                        <hi>Acolytes</hi> the Scripture makes no mention of,<note place="margin">Ex Amb. Calep.</note> by any such name. Indeede amongst the Philosophers the Stoicks vvere called <hi>Acolyts,</hi> because they alwaies followed their opinion, and did with obstinate pertinacitie cleaue to their doctrine, and counted it a shame to forsake the same. The Apostles had Ministers, who gaue attendance on them; as <hi>Onesimus,</hi>

Wherefore from the Archdeacon at their consecration they receiue a Taper, with a candlesticke and an empty pot: and because, when in time of persecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Christians for feare of their enemies met secretly in the night, and therefore had some whose duty it was to light Candles, both for necessitie and comelinesse, therefore now also we must haue <hi>Acolytes,</hi> at noone daies to carry Tapers; for it is so,<note n="c" place="margin">Quia c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

These are ordained by receiuing a booke of Coniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations or exorcismes at the hand of the Bishop, who saith; Receiue power to lay your hands vpon the possessed, and vpon new conuerts. The beginning of their office (some say) was from <hi>Salomon,</hi> of whom they falsely say, that he was the first Author of Exorcisme.</p>
                     <p>Exorcists<note n="b" place="margin">Act. 8.9. &amp; 13.8. &amp; 19.13.</note> there were among the Iewes; but they were Witches, Coniurers, Vagabonds, such as <hi>Simon Magus, E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lymas,</hi> and the sonnes of <hi>Sceua:</hi> they were not instituted by the Law, nor by the Gospell: they were very enemies vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Iesus Christ, and his Kingdome; and such are they also, vvhom the Romish church hath ordained to bee their suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessors.</p>
                     <p>No man can deny, but that our Sauiour Christ, sending forth his Apostles, gaue them power<note n="c" place="margin">Math. 10.8.</note> to cast out Diuels; and of the miraculous faith of some he saith,<note n="d" place="margin">Mar. vlt. 17.</note> that in his name they shall cast out Diuels: but this was a gift, not an order in the church. And that doth euidently appeare, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he saith not, that the Apostles, or Deacons, or they that are constituted in the holy orders of the church, shall be Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orcists; but these tokens shall follow them that beleeue. Wherefore, though<note n="e" place="margin">Bellar. lib de cleric. c. <hi>13.</hi>

                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> doth miserrably vexe and labour himselfe, to proue that Exorcists are an holy order; yet out of the booke of God, and the canonicall Scriptures, hee cannot bring one syllable or letter, to proue the same.</p>
                     <p>The gift of casting out of Diuels was for a time, to shew the glory and godhead of Iesus Christ, in whose name Diuels and vncleane spirits were subdued and ouercome. Now, that power is either ceased, or else is not commonly conferred, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther

Yea, by certaine Rites and so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn ceremonies with blowing, Crosses, Characters, Words, to turne bread into flesh: to bring downe the body of Christ from heauen: to sanctifie and giue diuine vertue vnto salt, oyle, water, hearbs, clothes, Candles, and such like; what is it else but very Magick, such as the Poet speaketh of?</p>

                     <p>Secondly, our Sauiour, nor his Apostles neuer did ordaine that men should wholly flye from their lawfull possessions, or that they should forsweare lawfull marriage, or hide them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues in Cloysters, or make Vowes, or ordaine new Euan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelicall rules and lawes; Nay, CHRIST telleth vs,<note n="e" place="margin">Math. 15.13.</note>

<pb n="561" facs="tcp:2645:328"/> lasted but a while in the Church: neither did the bretheren giue their goods to Monasteries: neither had they an Abbot or Prior ouer them: neither did they call their followers by their names: neither did any of them vow to feed on fish onely, or to liue in desart, or cloister: but they went abroad preaching the Gospell throughout the world.

                     <p>THe Kingdome of Christ and his supreame Regalitie by this brood of Traiterous Hypocrites, is violated, wron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged, impugned, and opposed; so that of them it may be true<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly verefied what is prophesied by <hi>Paul;</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>First, they are blindly superstitious, maintainers of Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and idle Ceremonies, by which the grace and Gospell of Christ is obscured. Nay, they are plaine enemies to the word of life, while they chiefely teach and perswade against the publishing of the mysteries of Saluation in a knowne tongue, by which the ignorant might bee edified, and weake consciences quieted.<note place="margin">Ex Math. Paris.</note> They so much maligne the Gospell of Christ, that about the yeare 1254 they made a new Gospell, the figment of their owne heads, which they called the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall Gospell, or the Gospell of the spirit of God, stuffed full of abominable errours and lies, by which the Gospell of Iesus Christ was vtterly defaced. For they openly professed therin, that the Canonicall Gospels, in respect of their Gospell, were no more then the Shell to the Kernell, or darknesse to light. They affirmed also, that the Gospell of Christ should be prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched but fifty yeares more: But their Gospell was eternall, and should endure for euer to rule the Church. Lastly, they boasted, that whatsoeuer the Bible contained, was in their Gospell to bee found.

                     </p>
                     <p>For, finding that they haue no sufficient ground or foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation in the booke of God for their superstition, they haue composed a booke of Diuels, taking proofe out of Hell to maintaine their Popery. Which, if the Diuell himselfe author of lies had not beene their Father, and Antichrist his first be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten sonne their Master, in whose kingdome of darknesse lies are in place of light, and strong illusions their best con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusions, they neuer durst to haue attempted.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the very foundations of their Abbeyes and Cloisters were erected vpon flagitious and heinous mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, bloudsheds, and other horrible crimes; so that their erecting, for the most part, was not from good, but from euil.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the victory and conquest of our great King of Kings, Iesus Christ, who by his death hath destroyed death, and triumphed ouer all the power of hell, is most shameful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the erection of Abbeyes dishonoured.<note n="b" place="margin">Pro remedio ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Fourthly, against the dignity of our heauenly King and Captaine it is, to take any names vpon vs, but his only. <hi>Esay</hi> speaking of the prosperitie of Christs Church saith;<note n="c" place="margin">Esay 52.6.</note>

                     <p>MAnifold are the iniuries, wherewith the Man of sinne hath disgraced, corrupted, and violated the holy office of the ministerie of the Gospell by IESVS CHRIST or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained. They affirme, that in Priesthood an indeleble Character, and such as can neuer bee abolished nor taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, is imprinted. So that, bee a Priest neuer so much sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, excommunicated, degraded, yet he hath still power to make the body of Christ, to binde and to loose. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding, what is more common with the <hi>Pope,</hi> then both by his Censures to suspend, and by his dispensation to take away this inextinguishable Character, and to make a lay-man of a Priest, and a common person of an holy.</p>
                     <p>The office of the Priest they somewhiles so extoll, that
<pb n="573" facs="tcp:2645:335"/> the Angels in heauen dare not aspire vnto that function: That the Virgin <hi>Mary</hi> her selfe could not take it vpon her: That she with eight words conceiued Christ once: These with fiue words euery day doe make him:<note place="margin">
                           <hi>Dist.</hi> 96.</note> that Cherubs and Seraphins dare not execute the ministry. Wherefore they say, that Priests are Fathers and masters of Kings and Princes; yet at other times they preferre Monks before Priests. Insomuch, that their Frierly orders onely are<note n="a" place="margin">Vid. Sūma An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel. in tit. religiosus.</note> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted properly religious. The Ministerie that Christ or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, is properly Secular, but in a large signification may be tearmed religious.</p>

                     <p>The office of the Ministers of the Gospel they most shame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lessely turne from the first institution, which was to preach the Gospell, into power of consecrating, and offering vp the body and bloud of Christ.

                        <hi>CHAP. XV. Apotheosis,</hi> or the exalting of the Romish Bishop aboue all that is called God.</head>
                     <p>HAuing spoken of the iniuries offered vnto the Sonne of GOD by the Romish Synagogue, who permitting him not to bee Lord ouer his owne house, thrust officers into his Church, such as hee neuer ordained nor knew:
<pb n="576" facs="tcp:2645:337"/> Now let vs examine whether the <hi>Lucifer</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> lift not vp himselfe aboue all that is called God.</p>
                     <p>And surely two things there are which make this our as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sertion euident to euery one that will considerately looke into the businesse.</p>
                     <p>The first is the ambitious Titles of insolent and into<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable arrogancie vvhich hee taketh to himselfe: The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond is the absolute, vnlimited, and lawlesse power which he vsurpeth.</p>
                     <p>This power and soueraigne Maiestie which he doth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercise, is twofold. The one Spirituall: The other Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall. The spirituall power hee claimeth is fourefold: The power of expounding and discerning Scriptures: Power of decreeing: Power of Iudging: and power of Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doning.</p>
                     <p>The Temporall power which he exerciseth, standeth in direction, and in destruction. The first is to prescribe and teach Kings and Princes, States and People what they shall doe, and how they shall gouerne: The second consisteth in the power destructiue of their authoritie, and in the power destructiue of their persons, by excommunicating and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing: by murthering and slaying of Princes: by discharging subiects from their oath and obedience to them.</p>
                     <p>To these ends and purposes tendeth all the power of our <hi>Nebuchadnezar:</hi> all the thundring Decrees and Decre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tals, Buls and Constitutions which hee sendeth forth. To this end onely are all his Friers and Iesuites imployed in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Kingdome and prouince, in euery part and angle of Christendome,<note n="a" place="margin">Iudg. 9.15.</note> That the Bramble may bee made King, and that all the trees may put their trust vnder his shadow: <hi>and if not, the fire shall come out of the Bramble, and consume the Cedars of Libanus.</hi>

                     <p>THe windy titles of ridiculous and vaine ambition, euen among the Heathen and prophanest Gentiles, they which had any spark of iudgement, or any feeling of humane infirmitie, haue alwaies blamed. Wherefore <hi>Domitian,</hi> who gaue vnto himselfe the title of Lord and God: and <hi>Caius,</hi> who would bee saluted by the name of <hi>Iupiter</hi> the great: And <hi>Sapores</hi> the <hi>Persian,</hi> who enstiled himselfe King of Kings, partaker with the Starres, brother of the Sunne and of the Moone: <hi>Hanno</hi> of <hi>Carthage,</hi> who by the tongues of Birds proclaimed himselfe a God: <hi>Alexander</hi> the great, who would bee called the sonne of <hi>Iupiter Hammon,</hi> all sober men haue esteemed as Monsters and intolerable burdens of the earth.</p>
                     <p>How much more abominable is it, that in the Church of Christ the milde and humble Shepheard, the gentle and lowly Sauiour,<note n="b" place="margin">Esay 42.3.</note> who breaketh not a bruised reede, and quencheth not the smoking flax:<note n="c" place="margin">Phil. 2.7.</note> who made himselfe of no reputation, and tooke on him the forme of a seruant, there should arise an Idol, puft vp with vanity and ventosity,<note n="d" place="margin">Ezech. 28.13.</note> in whose garment is euery precious stone; the <hi>Ruby,</hi> the <hi>Topaze,</hi> the <hi>Diamond,</hi> the <hi>Chrysolite,</hi> the <hi>Onyx,</hi> the <hi>Iasper</hi> and the <hi>Saphyr?</hi> To the making vp of whose ambitious stile, all tearmes of honour, all appellations of dignity, all words of soueraigntie must be sought for.</p>

                     <p>THe spirituall power of the Pope I haue formerly said to consist in foure things; namely, discerning and iudging of Scriptures: decreeing and promulging lawes: power of binding, iudging and condemning: power of loosing and pardoning. Of the first of these foure powers I haue intrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the Propheticall office. Now therefore let vs beginne with the second, which is the Lordlinesse and soueraignty hee chalengeth to himselfe, in thundering out Decrees and Constitutions, in giuing laws and commandements, which binde euery conscience, and constraine euery soule that will not runne into open heresie; the disobeying whereof is fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed with temporall and eternall death: with the wrath of
<pb n="582" facs="tcp:2645:340"/> God, with the high displeasure of the Apostles <hi>Peter</hi> &amp; <hi>Paul.</hi> Thus is our <hi>Domitian</hi> with fire both from hell and purgato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with curses also from earth and heauen, armed.</p>
                     <p>That the Papall decrees doe binde euery conscience to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience, it is an assured Axiome amongst them. Wherefore <hi>Gregory</hi> saith,<note n="a" place="margin">Nulli f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Another proofe, that the lawes of the <hi>Pope</hi> are equiualent with the lawes of Christ in the Romish church, is taken from the power of dispensing, which they arrogate to themselues.

For, whereas Christ the faithfull expounder of the Law alloweth not any diuorce,<note n="u" place="margin">Math. 5.32.</note> but onely for adultery, The Papall decrees allow diuers causes of diuorce, infirmitie of body, Frigiditie, Religion, and others: Hee giueth also dispensation to marry within degrees prohibited.

The one doth signifie the sword of the spirit, the word of God, which beateth downe all high things exalted against the truth: The other the sword of Mortification, with which euery man laboureth to roote sinne and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse out of himselfe: but the materiall sword<note n="e" place="margin">M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The spirituall destructiue sword of the <hi>Pope</hi> is exercised in interdictions, excommunications, suspensions, and such like; Of all which in the Romish church the abuse is intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</p>
                     <p>I know there is in the church a very necessarie vse of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication. First, when admonition taketh no place, it may be vsed towards offenders, euen in very small sinnes.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, against great and flagitious offences there is iust vse of excommunication; As <hi>Paul</hi>
                        <note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 5.5.</note> the Apostle vsed it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the incestuous person of <hi>Corinth.</hi> This iudgement of the church, soberly and holily exercised, our Sauiour Iesus Christ himselfe doth approue;<note n="i" place="margin">Math. 18.17.</note>
                        <hi>Tell it vnto the Church, And if he refuse to heare the Church also, let him be vnto thee as an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then man, and a Publican.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And lest any man should contemne this censure of the church, our Sauiour witnesseth, that what is here in such case done by the faithfull vpon the earth, hee himselfe vvill ratifie in Heauen;<note n="k" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 18.</note>
                        <hi>Whatsoeuer you binde on earth, shall be bound in heauen.</hi> It may not therefore bee thought, that such an Institution as the Lord himselfe hath left necessary to the gouernement of his Church, should be neglected, or despised.</p>
                     <pb n="587" facs="tcp:2645:343"/>
                     <p>Of Excommunication there are three ends; First, the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of God, lest Christians leading loose, and vngodly liues, the Gospell should bee euill spoken of: and the Church of Christ, which is his owne body, should seeme to bee but a rabble of prophane, dissolute, gracelesse, and disordered per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons. Wherefore such are cut off as rotten members, and cast out as vnprofitable branches, that the body of Christ and his Vineyard may bee faire and beautifull;<note n="l" place="margin">Cant. 6.9.</note>
                        <hi>Faire as the Moone, pure as the Sunne, terri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                           </gap>le as an Armie with Ban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners:</hi> and this is the cause, why Ministers ought also care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully to reiect them from the Communion, whom they know to walke inordinately, and to bee an open scandall to the Church.</p>
                     <p>The second vse or end of Excommunication is, lest by the continuall company and conuersation of the wicked the godly should be peruerted: and this end of Excommunica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the Apostle speaketh of where he saith;<note n="m" place="margin">1. Cor. 5.6.</note>
                        <hi>Know yee not that a little leauen leaueneth the whole lumpe?</hi> And vnto <hi>Timothy;</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>The third end of Excommunication is, that the offender himselfe may be ashamed of his sinne, and flee from the same. Hereof the Apostle speaketh to the <hi>Thessalonians;</hi>
                        <note n="o" place="margin">2. Thes. 3.14.</note>
                        <hi>If any man obey not our sayings, note him by a letter, and haue no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with him, that he may be ashamed.</hi> And this was the end of the excommunication of the incestuous <hi>Corinthian</hi> also, that<note n="p" place="margin">1.

                        <hi>such one by the power of our Lord Iesus Christ be deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Sathan for the destruction of the flesh, That the spirit may be saued in the day of the Lord Iesus.</hi> And therefore hee is said to be deliuered to Sathan, Because all that is out of the church, is vnder the tyranny of the Diuell. Of <hi>Hymenaeus</hi> and <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lexander</hi> the Apostle witnesseth;<note n="q" place="margin">1. Tim. 1.20.</note>
                        <hi>I deliuered them to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than, that they should learne not to blaspheme:</hi> And to his <hi>Thessalonians</hi> hee writeth,<note n="r" place="margin">2.

                     </p>

First, they neuer vsed this binding Key of the church, but against them<note n="s" place="margin">Math. 18.17.</note> that were open sinners, or such with whom admonishment could not preuaile.

                     <p>Confession is also an internall part of repentance, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which repentance is no repentance; For God abhorreth the scarifying &amp; couering of sinne.

                        <note n="d" place="margin">Ios. 7.19.</note>
                        <hi>My sonne, I beseech thee giue glory to the Lord God of Israel, and make confession vnto him, and shew me now what thou hast done, hide it nrt from me.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>This kinde of Confession belongeth to all offenders who are brought before any Magistrate in causes criminall, and to all them which haue matters of Controuersie depending be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any humane tribunall, to confesse sincerely the truth of the businesse, euen as in the sight of GOD; For
<pb n="597" facs="tcp:2645:348"/> hereto are they bound in Conscience.</p>
                     <p>A second kinde of Confession there is in Scripture, which is called brotherly Confession. And hereof two kindes are found; the one for our own sakes, and the other for our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren. Of the first Saint <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh;<note n="e" place="margin">Iam. 5.16.</note>
                        <hi>Acknowledge your faults one to another, and pray one for another.</hi> Surely, of this kinde of Confession there is great and good vse in the Church. For when the conscience is affrighted with the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour of offences, and feeleth a wauering distrust and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulnesse in it selfe, what can be better done then to choose some godly and wise brother either of the Ministers of Christ, or of the Laicks, to whom wee may vnfould our dangers, and of whom we may desire aduice and comfort ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the word of God. <hi>Seneca</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Seneca.</note> doth well obserue, that all offences are the lighter, when they are imparted to others. In truth (saith he) as to tell the dreame, is a token that wee are awake: So to acknowledge our sinnes, is a signe that wee desire to amend.</p>
                     <p>A second kinde of priuate and brotherly Confession there is, when vnto our brother whom wee haue offended, wee acknowledge the offence, seeking to reconcile our selues vnto him. This our Sauiour commandeth,<note n="f" place="margin">Math. 5.24.</note>
                        <hi>Go thy way; first, be reconciled to thy brother, and then come and offer thy gift.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>The third kinde of confession is vnto God, and this is of two kindes also.</p>
                     <p>The first confession is of praise, either priuately in the closet of our owne heart, or openly in the Congregation. Hereof the Psalmist speaketh;<note n="g" place="margin">Consitebimur tibi deus. <hi>Psal. 75.1.</hi>

                        <hi>Tell your children of it, and let your children shew it to their children, and their children to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other generation.</hi> And the Prophet <hi>Dauid</hi> againe saith;<note n="i" place="margin">Psal. 149.1.</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>The second is the Confession of sinnes vnto God, when a wounded conscience layeth open it selfe vnto him willing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, from whom it cannot be hid, and casteth downe his bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den at the footstoole of his mercy.

                     <p>This Confession of sinnes vnto God is three-fold; Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uate in our secret meditations, whereof <hi>Dauid</hi> speaketh;<note n="m" place="margin">Psal. 6.6.</note>

                     <p>To this purpose were many excellent Psalmes of <hi>Dauid</hi> compiled, euen to acknowledge in the Temple publiquely, the transgression of the people. As the twelfth, the seuentie ninth, the hundreth fortie &amp; third Psalm, and sundry other.</p>

And to the imitation hereof the Church hath alwaies vsed disciplinarie confession of sinnes, to bee done by flagitious and scandalous persons openly in the Church, to humble them before GOD; to make them the more to abhorre their sinne: to satisfie the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation and to deterre others from the like wickednesse. But in all these kinds of Confession, the Popish Auricular

                     <p>We must vnderstand, that when Confession is either pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uately, or publiquely made vnto God, by an heart which hath a true and earnest feeling of the intolerable burden of his offences, in a liuely faith, laying hold on the promises of God through IESVS CHRIST, <hi>God is faithfull</hi>

                     <p>To this I answer, that <hi>Panormitan</hi> himself acknowledgeth, that confession is not of Gods lawe, but of mans lawe.

                        </note> Christ instituted the Sacrament of Confession secretly: but the Apostles did openly Promulge the same, and expressely, as in the fift of <hi>Iames.</hi> It seemeth therefore, that there is in their owne opinion no other di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect and plaine sentence of Scripture to proue Sacramentall Confession, but this onely out of the Epistle of Saint <hi>Iames.</hi> To answere the which, I say, that <hi>Iames</hi> speaketh not a word of Auricular Confession in secret, Nor of Sacramentall Confession to a Priest: But onely of confession one to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, which is brotherly confession.</p>

                        <hi>that beleeued came, and confessed, and shewed their workes; Ergo,</hi> Auricular confession hath ground in Scripture.</p>
                     <p>All the Iesuits in the world cannot out of this proposition Syllogistically conclude, That Auricular confession hath ground in Scripture. For it is not said, that they confessed to a Priest, or that they confessed euery particular sinne: But onely that they acknowledged their former waies to be wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked; and therefore they confessed their works and brought the bookes of curious Arts, and burned them before all men. This is rather open, then Auricular confession.</p>
                     <p>Hauing answered their arguments which haue any mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in them, Let vs now at last see how this yoake of Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonish bondage is iniurious to the freedom of our Ierusalem, and King thereof Iesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>First, it is imposed vpon the church vnder paine of dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation;
<pb n="607" facs="tcp:2645:353"/> which is directly no where deliuered, or comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Scripture. For in the holy word auricular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fession hath no promise if we doe it, nor threatening at all if we do it not. Wherefore in such cases, wherein the Scripture hath not decreed, there to vrge with such violence their owne traditions, is most iniurious to Christs supreame Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>galitie.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, in steed of free Iustification in the bloud of Christ, The ceremonie of confession maketh the enumerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our sinnes to deserue remission of sinnes, diminution of punishment, opening the gates of Paradise, hope of sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uation, and such like. Wherefore it turneth the Gospell into the law, making grace no grace, and forgiuenesse no for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giuenesse.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it bringeth the conscience into doubt, and doth depriue the soule of all hope and comfort. For who can tell, whether whom he chuseth to confesse vnto, bee a Priest? Whether hee hath the Key of Power? Whether hee hath the Key of knowledge? or, since the sanctification of the Sacrament consisteth in the sanctification of the Priest, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Sacrament be auaileable or not? Whether wee haue duely numbred all our offences? Whether he enioyne suffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient penance?</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it wresteth the power of remission and saluati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on out of the hand of Christ, and giueth it vnto men, while they teach, that forgiuenesse is denied vnto them, whom the Priest will not forgiue. What is this but to bind Iesus Christ the Sonne of God, the King of glory, to the pleasure of a Priest? They shame not to professe, that Priests haue power ouer the body of Christ in the Sacrament: but herein they giue power<note n="v" place="margin">Bell. l. <hi>3.</hi> de poenit. c <hi>2</hi> verbo tertio colligitur.</note> to an ignorant Priest ouer the soule and the will of Iesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, they giue a tyrannicall power vnto Priests ouer the spirits and consciences of men in their confession; Insomuch that the old prouerbe witnesseth; to meete a Priest in the Lent is no lesse valour, then to encounter a Wolfe,<note place="margin">Aeneas Syluius i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Sixtly, their confession is full of superstition. For it must not bee done but by the mouth: Hee that confesseth by writing or otherwise, doth nothing Sacramentally; as though God more accepted the confession which is by word, then that which is by writing.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, their Confession is the encreasing of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie also, in that they teach, the sacramentall act thereof may be without loue, then it is also without God; and an euill act may be part of a Sacrament.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, infinite are the questions which out of this their feigned Sacrament doe arise.</p>

                     <p>Lastly, there remaineth reconciliation to God;<note place="margin">The third cause of Christs comming.</note> and that also wee haue found in Iesus Christ.

And againe:<note n="q" place="margin">Ibid. ver. 21.</note> you which were sometime stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and enemies by cogitation, in euill works, hath he now yet reconciled.

By this it is manifest, that Christ hath not so reconciled vs to God, as Hypocrites are one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciled to another, retaining still a minde to punish and reuenge when oportunitie serueth: But hee hath sincerely and truely reconciled vs to God, taking our sinnes from vs, and Gods wrath and punishment from him.

                        </note> he satisfieth God for his own offences committed, both veniall, and mortall.</p>
                     <p>In the Primitiue church, I confesse, there were Penitenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all Canons or rules how to receiue those that were for their heinous enormities cast out of the same: but these were not esteemed as satisfactions vnto God, but vnto men: Not vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the heauenly eyes of the Lord of all spirits and powers,
<pb n="619" facs="tcp:2645:359"/> but they were onely satisfactions to the offended brethren, and did testifie the repentance of him that was to bee absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued. This discipline in it selfe was good and godly, and I could wish it might be restored againe.</p>
                     <p>These satisfactions vsed in the ancient church were yet but humane constitutions; and therefore they could not sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie God, nor sanctifie sinners in his sight, Much lesse the foolish and superstitious <hi>whippings, Hayre-cloth, Fastings,</hi> num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bring of <hi>Prayers,</hi> enioyned by the Romish Prelacie.</p>
                     <p>Nothing can satisfie for the breach of the law, but the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty the lawgiuer appointeth. Euen amongst men, tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Princes would thinke themselues mocked, if a man should commit murther, and then choose vnto himselfe a penance of barefoote wandring, or by the fauour of an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riour iudge vndergoe some lighter paine, then that vvhich a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst murther is by the law inflicted.</p>
                     <p>Against all these Romish satisfactions wee may iustly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect, they haue no authoritie nor example for any such in the holy word. Christ neuer gaue power to his Ministers to enioine men to say prayers by number: to fast two or three daies a weeke with bread and water. He neuer ordained any man to whip himselfe: to weare a shirt of hayre-cloth: to goe barefoote on Pilgrimage: to visite the dead bones and reliques of Saints. Wherefore it is without authoritie, whatsoeuer is done in this manner; yea, against the royalty of the Sonne of God they most traiterously offend, vvho torture his people, burden his church, afflict his members with this tyranny, hauing receiued no such power, no such commandement.</p>
                     <p>My methode in intreating on this point shall be, first, to shew the Popish position touching their Plenary Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions: Secondly, to answere the arguments they bring in defence of them: Lastly, I will shew, how iniurious they are to the Regall power of our Lord and Sauiour Iesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Summa Angelica▪</hi> saith,<note n="b" place="margin">In tit satan ipso princip.</note> Satisfaction is sometimes taken for reconciliation, and so it conteineth in it selfe all the parts of Penance: but it is otherwise taken for the paiment of the
<pb n="620" facs="tcp:2645:360"/> due paine, and fulfilling of the punishment deserued. And he saith,<note n="c" place="margin">Ibid.</note> That with the help of God, that is, the merit and passion of Christ conioined, a man may satisfie for his sinnes vnto God, that is (saith <hi>Granatensis</hi>)<note n="d" place="margin">Granat. in memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria de satisfactione.</note> for veniall sinnes, and <hi>the guilt of temporall paine, and not for the guilt of euerlasting paine.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Iohn de Combis</hi> saith,<note n="e" place="margin">Io de Comb. de sac. virt. l. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>29.</hi>
                        </note> that as in warres and other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trouersies; when peace and friendship is made, yet recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the wrong is not presently had: So after the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giueness of the fault, whether in contrition, or confession, the debt of satisfaction of punishment doth still remaine. Now the Priest that giueth penance (hee saith) enioineth some things as the foundation of Sanctification;<note place="margin">Io. de Comb. ibid.</note> Namely, to restore that which is vniustly taken away, to abstaine from sinne hereafter: Some things are enioined for the better ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition of Satisfaction; as to auoide the company of the euill: Some things hee enioineth as the substance of Satisfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction; as to fast, to watch, to giue almes, to goe on Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>máge, and such like: Some things hee enioineth as the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of Satisfaction; as the workes of supererogation. Now he saith, satisfaction must be answerable to the fault in three things; in Number, in Weight, in Measure: but these three are not necessarily required, but by way of conue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience.</p>
                     <p>Of Satisfaction<note n="g" place="margin">Ex eodem cap. <hi>30</hi>
                        </note> there are three principall parts; Prayer, Fasting, and Almes. The other are secondary meanes; as Watching, Pilgrimage, and Disciplining. To Fasting belong all works of afflicting the flesh: To Prayer all spirituall workes: To Almes all workes of mercy.</p>
                     <p>The sufficiency of these satisfactions is diuers waies per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued. First, by the points from whence, and whither they moue. In fasting, we remoue from the Concupiscence of the flesh to good ordering of our selues: In Prayer, from Pride of life to the seruice of God: In Almes, from the concupis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the eyes to the reliefe of our neighbour; Secondly, by the matter it selfe. Almes satisfieth by our externall goods: Prayer satisfyeth by the powers of the minde: Fasting by the
<pb n="621" facs="tcp:2645:360"/> powers of the body: Thirdly, Satisfaction is made three manner of waies; by Punishment, by Redemption, by Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication. The first is done in Fasting: The second in Almes: The third in Prayer.</p>
                     <p>Three effects also <hi>de Combis</hi> maketh of Satisfaction; ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining grace: Remission of the fault: taking away of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liques of sinne. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> defineth Satisfaction to be,<note n="h" place="margin">Satisfaction<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Satisfaction (he saith) is of two kindes, according as Iustice is also; One, that absolutely and perfectly performeth what is due:<note n="i" place="margin">Ibid. verb. iam igitur.</note> An other, that consisteth in imperfect equalitie; as when he that is wronged to the summe of ten thousand Talents, is satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with all the substance a man hath, though it amount not to any such valew. Now God (hee saith) cannot bee satisfied according to perfect and equall satisfaction, but vnperfect and vnequall, by his owne acceptation.</p>
                     <p>The reasons which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> bringeth to proue that Man may satisfie God for sinne, are few, and wretched.<note place="margin">Ob.</note> The first is;<note n="k" place="margin">

                     <p>Here is no mention of Satisfaction; if his people repent,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> God promiseth mercy. Now where full Satisfaction is made, there iustice healeth the land, not mercy: But God here pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miseth to bee mercifull to them, if they turne vnto him. Which sufficiently sheweth, that our turning to GOD is no sufficient recompence vnto him, or satisfaction. Where vvas the Friers Logicke, when hee imagined this to be an argument? All the Iesuits in Christendome cannot make a concluding Syllogisme of this proposition in moode and forme.</p>

<pb n="623" facs="tcp:2645:361"/> efficiently, but declaringly; they are witnesses and signes that God is satisfied for our sinnes by Iesus Christ, they are not the satisfaction it selfe.</p>
                     <p>The Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> bringeth two arguments to proue satisfaction by our owne workes. The first;<note place="margin">Ob.</note> wee are made conformable to the passions of Christ; <hi>Ergo,</hi> our works doe satisfie as Christs did.</p>
                     <p>The Apostle <hi>Peter</hi>
                        <note n="p" place="margin">1. Pet. 2.21.</note> sheweth wherein this conformity doth consist; <hi>He suffered, leauing vs an ensample;</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Sol,</note> Not to sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfie for sinne as hee satisfied: but to follow his innocency and his patience, as much as we can. Wherefore <hi>Paul</hi> saith not, that our workes made vs like: but that hee foresaw, and predestinated vs to bee made like to the image of his Sonne; But Predestination is of free grace, not of workes.</p>
                     <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith; <hi>I can doe all things in him that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth me;</hi> therefore our workes in Christ may satisfie.<note place="margin">Ob.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>By this reason <hi>Paul</hi> might redeeme the world,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> destroy death, bring vs to life. If this be granted, there shall bee no difference in power betweene the head and the members of the Church. The meaning of the place is, that <hi>Paul</hi> by the grace of God was made able to endure afflictions. What is this to satisfaction?</p>
                     <p>You haue heard what weake shadowes of arguments are brought by the Aduersary for these satisfactions of mens workes. Now let vs consider, whether they derogate from our King of Kings Iesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>First, note, good reader, the wicked fallacitie and falsifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion practised by the Romish church. The ancient Fathers indeed had a certaine brotherly satisfaction, by which noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious offenders did satisfie with certaine disciplinary humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the scandalized congregation. This they haue turned into satisfaction before God himselfe for sinne: They haue also peruerted the order of the Primitiue Church. For the ancient Church, vpon publique satisfaction, absolued the offender: The Popish church absolueth first, and then en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ioineth penance and satisfaction after.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Popish satisfactions detract from the conquest
<pb n="624" facs="tcp:2645:362"/> of our triumphant King Iesus Christ, as though Christ were not a sufficient Sauiour: as though hee had not sufficiently cleansed: as though he were a Redeemer in part onely. But he pronounceth of the taking away of the punishment, as well as of the guilt;<note n="q" place="margin">Ose 13.14.</note>

                     <p>Thirdly, these satisfactions are iniurious vnto the infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite, supreame, and dreadfull Maiestie of God, when wee suppose that our beggerly base rags, our weaknes, our pouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, can bring forth any worke worthy of his fauour, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digne to his loue, answerable to his righteousnes, satisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to his Maiestie: or that is able to stand, or to appeare be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God to answere him.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Iesus Christ hath no where in his Gospell left a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny authority to his Ministers, to enioine vnto men any kind of punishment, by which they should satisfie for sinne. Wherefore it is perfidious treacherie against the Sonne of GOD, thus to belye him, and to beare men in hand, that they haue receiued power from CHRIST to enioine such penance.</p>

                     <p>Sixtly, most derogatorie it is vnto CHRIST, to deuise workes, such as God hath not commanded; as the wearing of iron and of haire-cloth vpon the naked flesh: building of Abbeyes: going on Pilgrimage to satisfie for sinne, seeing the workes that Christ himselfe commandeth, haue no such power; When ye haue done all these things say,<note n="w" place="margin">Luke 17.</note>

                     <p>Seuenthly, by this opinion of satisfaction through our own workes, they haue taught men to exercise cruelty on their owne bodies; as <hi>Olaus</hi> King of <hi>Sueuia,</hi> who on a Sunday cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting sticks off a Rod that he held in his hand, being admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shed it was the Sabbath day, gathered vp the chips, &amp; burned them in his own hand to ashes. <hi>Bernard</hi>

                     </p>
                     <p>Christ, as God, forgiueth sinnes by power: and as Man, Christ himselfe forgiueth by preaching. By the coniunction of natures indeed in one person, effectually, and powerfully

                     <p>Concerning the applying, and dispensing of the merits of Christ and of Saints, by his Apostles to the Church, the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture speaketh not. Ministers truely are required to be good and faithfull stewards, to diuide the word aright, pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the iudgements of God to the impenitent, and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies to penitent sinners: but to apply these things to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science of man, it is the office of our faith, directed by the spirit of God. If by applying the treasure of merits in the Church, bee vnderstood giuing of such, or such measure, or number of supererrogatory workes vnto this, or that man, it is so farre from the truth, that there is no mention hereof in the holy word. Therefore the <hi>Tridentine</hi> Councell is compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led to confesse,<note n="g" place="margin">Conc. Trid. de instit. sac. poen.</note>
                        <hi>that the sacrament of Penance was not in the old law;</hi> nay, it was not in the Gospell neither, till after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>surrection; as the same Councell of <hi>Trent</hi> confesseth, where it saith, that <hi>it was instituted at the time, when Christ breathing vpon his Apostles, said, Receiue ye the holy Ghost.</hi> But howsoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer; the distributing of the treasure of the Church by a Priest, is no where found in Scripture: neither can any Prelate by the word of Christ, chalenge power to take frō one, that w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> is more then enough, and giue to another to satisfie withall.</p>

                        <hi>Peter</hi> concerning merit and satisfaction, maketh the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test Apostles equall to the whole multitude of the Church. For he saith;<note n="h" place="margin">Act. 15.11</note>
                        <hi>We beleeue, through the grace of our Lord Iesus Christ to be saued, euen as they doe.</hi>

                     <pb n="634" facs="tcp:2645:368"/>
                     <p>Wherefore, let vs now come to the arguments which they bring for this authoritatiue remission of sinnes, and for this treasure of merits, whereof they make themselues Stewards.</p>

<pb n="635" facs="tcp:2645:368"/> there was any want or defect in the afflictions of Christ as concerning redemption. For he testified before, that<note n="o" place="margin">Col. 1.14.</note>
                        <hi>wee haue redemption through his bloud,</hi> that is, <hi>the remission of sinnes.</hi> The meaning of the Apostle is, that hee supplied in his flesh, that which wanted of the afflictions of Christ. For Christ suffereth also in his members. And as the naturall body of Christ suffered for the expiation of sinne: So the spirituall body, which is the Church, suffereth for sundry causes: to glorifie God, to witnesse his truth, to animate and encourage the weake, to winne the Aduersaries. For the bloud of the Martyrs is the seed of the Church: and all these afflictions of his members Christ accounteth his owne afflictions. Now where <hi>Paul</hi> saith, that <hi>He doth this for the Church,</hi> he meaneth not to redeeme, or to satisfie for the Church: but to edifie the Church, to giue example, to confirme their faith by all the meanes he could; as he himselfe expoundeth himselfe in the verses following,<note n="p" place="margin">Col. 1.28.</note>

And this in brotherly charitie the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stle himselfe is ready, and perswadeth the <hi>Corinthians</hi> also to forgiue, and receiue the penitent offender into the church againe.

                        <hi>CHAP. XXIII.</hi> The beginning and increase of Popish Indulgences.</head>
                     <p>TOuching the Originall and increase of Indulgences in the Church, by the ancient Ecclesiasticall Histories it is manifest, that at the first, Indulgences were onely relaxations of those Mulcts and punishments, which by the penitentiall Canons were inflicted vpon publique offenders. And yet in the ancient writers the word <hi>Indulgence</hi> is but very rare, and
<pb n="638" facs="tcp:2645:370"/> hardly found, though Moderation, Relaxation, Mitigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and Remission of the asperitie of Penitentiall Canons, be often vsed.</p>
                     <p>The eleuenth Canon of<note n="a" place="margin">Nicē. Cō. Can <hi>11.</hi>
                        </note> the <hi>Nicene</hi> Councell saith, that they vvhich without cause denied the faith, were accoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted worthy of no mercy: yet the Councell shewing huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitie and compassion towards them, enioineth ten yeares of penance.</p>

To them<note n="c" place="margin">Can. <hi>22.</hi> ibid.</note> that killed a man vnwillingly, the former rule appointed seuen yeares of penance: But the <hi>Ancy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ran</hi> Councell more mildly censuring, saith fiue yeares shall suffice.</p>

                     <p>After the inflicting then of the penitentiall Satisfactions of the Church, yet many times, either by the intercession of godly persons, or of the people, such penance was<note n="e" place="margin">Vid Euseb. l. <hi>6.</hi> cap. <hi>42.</hi> Vid. etiam. Cyp. l. <hi>3.</hi> Ep. <hi>15.16.18.</hi>
                        </note> some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time mitigated, and sometimes wholly forgiuen: yea, the Bishops themselues often seeing signes of true and vnfained repentance, did either moderate, or remit the Penance. And this authoritie both the fift Canon of the <hi>Nicen</hi> Councell, and the first Canon of the <hi>Ancyran</hi> giueth vnto Bishops and Priests.</p>
                     <p>Tract of time corrupted at last this godly order of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Church, and inclined by little and little to superstition. For after the false opinion, that Penance did satisfie Gods iustice, began to spring vp in the church, the burdens of satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions grew to be heauy and intolerable. Whereupon Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demptions and Commutations of those Satisfactorie pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments began to be in vse.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Burchardus</hi> out of the Roman Penitentiall rehearseth many
<pb n="639" facs="tcp:2645:370"/> things touching the redemption of Satisfactions; as, for one day fasting with bread and water, to say fifty Psalmes knee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, or seuenty Psalmes standing, and to relieue one poore man. A rich man that cannot say Psalmes,<note place="margin">Ex Chemnic.</note> may redeeme his Penance with three pence giuen in Almes. The poore with a penny, or the feeding of three poore people. A weekes Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance is redeemed with three hundred Psalmes: one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth, with a thousand &amp; two hundred; and diuers such other in <hi>Burchardus</hi> you may see.</p>
                     <p>Out of these Commutations grew sundry euils, but this especially: men beeing perswaded, that through them God was satisfied as concerning sinne, they began to despise ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest repentance; yea, and to sinne of purpose, that they might obtaine remission. <hi>Burchardus</hi> reciteth a Canon of the <hi>Cabilonen</hi> Councell against them that sinned wilfully, for that by their Almes deeds they promised themselues impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie: And of Priests (hee saith) that they were negligent in good workes, for that they tooke themselues to bee purged from sinne, if they trauelled to <hi>Rome,</hi> or <hi>Turon,</hi> or such like places. To all such <hi>Ierome</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Ierom.</note> well saith; Not to haue seene <hi>Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rusalem,</hi> but to haue liued godly at <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is praise-worthy.</p>
                     <p>Another inclination and decay of Penitentiall discipline ensued also. For, whereas at the first all penance was not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muted, but only part, it came to passe, that a man for money might redeeme the whole Penitentiall Satisfaction: And of the solemne publique repentance the Romish church now hath scarce the shadow left; for it is all turned into playes and toyes. In the beginning of Lent they sprinkle as well one as other with ashes: Some are hired to whip thēselues. In <hi>Halberstat</hi> at the beginning of Lent, they hyre one that must be cast out of the Church: and being clad in beggerly gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, shall walke about the towne, and lye in the streets all night, being fed at mens doores as long as Lent endured; and this man they call <hi>Adam:</hi> he must wait daily before the doores of the Church, vntill the day of the Lords supper come; when the Archdeacon crauing absolution for him of
<pb n="640" facs="tcp:2645:371"/> the Bishop, bringeth him into the church; where Indulgen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence is granted to him. Thus the ancient discipline of the church is turned into Maskes and Enterludes.</p>
                     <p>At last came vp Pardons for sinne, by authoritie of the Pope, about the yeeare 1100. And of the Scholasticall wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters some feined, that by them, and the satisfactions enioi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, the paine due vnto sinne was taken away: Other said, they tooke away both fault and punishment,<note place="margin">Ru<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Some taught, that by them the eternall paine after due contrition was turned into temporall paine, and that the temporall paine also was in part by absolution remitted; and for that which remained, Satisfactions must be enioined, and these Satisfactions by Indulgences remitted.</p>
                     <p>To make the better Mart of their Pardons, they feined, that the Satisfactions enioined by a Priest, were not sufficient to take away the punishment of sinne, without Purgatory. Wherefore <hi>Scotus</hi> saith, After the Priests absolution a man must flye either to Purgatorie, or to Pardons: and these Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons (they say) doe remit all Satisfactions enioined as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishments for sinne, or which might haue beene enioined, either by the Priest, or by the Penitentiall Canons, or by the iustice of God: yet so, as the iustice of God must haue an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ualent satisfaction out of the treasure of the Church, which the Pope may dispose.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Iohannes Angelus.</note>Then began some to teach, That the soules in Purgatory were of the Popes Iurisdiction, and that hee might empty Purgatorie at once, if hee pleased: That the soules to whom Indulgences were granted, went presently to Heauen: That the Pope had power to command the Angels of God to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiue them.<note place="margin">Bull.

                     <p>Finding the sweetnesse of gaine, and as their vvealth increased, their couetousnesse increasing, they inuented <hi>Iubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lees</hi> also.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Boniface</hi> ordained, that in euery hundreth yeare the <hi>Iubilee</hi>
                        <pb n="641" facs="tcp:2645:371"/> should be celebrated at <hi>Rome,</hi> and Pardons granted to all that repaired thither.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Clement</hi> the sixt ordained, that because the time of mans life is short, therfore the <hi>Iubilee</hi> should be kept euery fiftieth yeere.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Gregory</hi> the eleuenth brought it to the thirtieth yeere. At last, <hi>Paul</hi> the second, with <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth, appointed the <hi>Iubilee</hi> on euery fiue and twentieth yeare. Because many impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent persons could nor trauaile to <hi>Rome</hi> (yet they which were weake in body, had perhaps strength in purse) of later yeares the Romish Prelates haue sent their Legats through sundry Prouinces, with power to grant as plenary Indulgences, as if they had repaired themselues to <hi>Rome;</hi> yea, vnto diuers Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nasteries, Conuents, Colledges, Chapters, Hospitals, vvith certaine Limitations the like power hath been granted; for, <hi>dulcis odor lucri.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dulcis odor lucri.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Many times Indulgences granted by preceding Popes, were reuoked by their successours, that they might be brought anew, and with great summes obtained; yea, and the Mona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steries, or Prelates, to whom power is granted of conferring Indulgences, are suspended often from this their power, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther during the <hi>Iubilee,</hi> or during the Popes pleasure, that the Monopoly of <hi>Rome</hi> may the better prosper.</p>
                     <p>Confessionaries were also ordained, that if a man should hereafter commit any sinne, hee might haue power to chuse his Confessor; who by the Bull had authoritie to absolue him once, or twice, or oftner in a yeare; yea, how oft soeuer, from his sinne.</p>
                     <p>The most cunning cosonage, and artificiall tricke is, in granting Indulgences to men in their death beds. For, if a man in his life time bought many Pardons, yet if he died not presently (they say) by new offences new guilt is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted. Wherefore, that men might bee free from Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, it was deuised, that Pardons should bee granted on the death-bed; and these were so much the dearer, because they gaue a ready &amp; speedy passage into heauen. Of this kind <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genius</hi> the fourth granted many about the yeere 1440; as <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tony</hi> doth witnes: and <hi>Gerson</hi> also before this time speaketh
<pb n="642" facs="tcp:2645:372"/> of the like: And because a Priest could not bee alwaies had vpon the sodaine, power was giuen vpon necessitie that a lay-man might pronounce the absolution.</p>
                     <p>Let mee not ouerpasse the Pardons in the Stations of the Churches in <hi>Rome.</hi> Stations were at the first the solemne festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall daies of euery Church; in which the people assembled to heare the word preached, and to communicate of the holy Eucharist; And of such Stations <hi>Gregory</hi> speaketh in his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies. But afterward it was turned into the visitation of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine Churches in <hi>Rome,</hi> which whoso did performe, of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny pardons was partaker. <hi>Boniface</hi> the eighth gaue this priui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the Church of Saint <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi> onely. <hi>Clement</hi> thereto added the <hi>Lateran</hi> Church. <hi>Sixtus</hi> the fourth the great Church of Saint <hi>Mary.</hi> But in tract of time the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize prospered so vvell, that the rest of the Churches of the Citie of <hi>Rome</hi> obtained this honour and priuiledge also.</p>
                     <p>In the Lateran church is euery day Indulgence for fortie eight yeares, and so many Lents: and remission of the third part of a mans sinnes.</p>
                     <p>Pope <hi>Syluester</hi> and <hi>Gregory,</hi> who consecrated it, gaue so many Indulgences to it, as no man can reckon but God on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. And <hi>Boniface</hi> saith; If any come to our seat of <hi>Lateran</hi> for deuotion and prayers sake, hee shall be absolued from all his sinnes.</p>
                     <p>In the Chappell which is called <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum,</hi> into which no woman may come, there are the staires w<seg rend="sup">ch</seg> stood before <hi>Pilats</hi> doore in <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which consist of eight and and twenty steps. Whosoeuer vpon deuotion goeth vp these steps, hath nine yeares of Pardon for euery step, vvith so many Lents, and remission of the third part of his sinnes: And hee that kneeling goeth vp the said steps, deliuereth a soule out of Purgatory, for which he prayeth. And in the day of the dedication of this Church, there is full remission of all sinnes, both from fault, and punishment; at the first gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of which Indulgence, the Angels in the presence of all the people said, <hi>Amen.</hi>

                     <pb n="643" facs="tcp:2645:372"/>
                     <p>When <hi>Gregory</hi> did dedicate this Church, he gaue as many daies of pardon, as there be drops of raine, when it raineth three daies and nights together: And when <hi>Gregory</hi> himselfe feared, lest he had been too prodigall of grace, and had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hausted the treasure of the Church too much, Christ appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to him gaue him leaue to grant more Pardons yet, for the people had need of them.</p>

                     <p>LEt vs now at last consider, how this Mart of Indulgences is iniurious to the Kingdome of Iesus Christ, and what wrong their Simoniacall Merchandize of grace offereth to his Regall power.</p>
                     <p>First, it is horrible treason against the Maiesty of Christ, that they teach, Priests to be indued with power to enioine workes of Penance, which may take away sinne. For it gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth such authoritie vnto his Ministers, as Christ neuer gaue them. Certaine it is, to enioyne Fastings, Pilgri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, Almes, for satisfaction, Christ neuer commanded. Almes is to be done cheerefully, and in obedience to God;<note place="margin">2. Cor. 9.7.</note> not coactedly, not as by compulsion, and by way of pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, it is a wicked derogation from the fulnesse of the satisfaction made by Christ, that the Priest should dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the superfluitie of the merits of Saints, to bee our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; As though the temporall chastisement, vvhich Christs merits could not satisfie for, the merits of Saints could take away: As though, what all the power and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits
<pb n="644" facs="tcp:2645:373"/> of Christ could not doe, the very superfluitie of Saints merits could doe.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they most shamefully peruert and misconstrue the institution of our Sauiour IESVS CHRIST; Who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuers sinnes you remit, they are remitted. For herein (they say) Ministers haue power onely to take away the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment, but not the fault. But the words of Christ are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerall; <hi>Whose sinnes soeuer,</hi> not whose punishment soeuer. As in Excommunication, sinne is retained both as concerning the fault, and the punishment: So in Absolution, the fault and punishment is forgiuen, that is, by the warrant of the word the forgiuenes is pronounced.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if this authoritie of remitting the punishment of sinne in Priests, be from God and by his law, Most impious are the Popes which abridge the same; as <hi>Innocentius</hi> the third, who in the <hi>Lateran</hi> Councell limited and restrained other Bishops, that they should not grant Indulgences but for one yeare. But if these Indulgences be not from Christ, they are false traitors that vsurpe the Regal power of Christ in pardo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning sinne, hauing therto no Commission, but what they haue from the Man of <hi>Rome,</hi> to whom Christ no where gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth Commission from himselfe to poure authoritie into o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers of forgiuing sinnes.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, this doctrine is a most dangerous doctrine, and breedeth despaire. For,<note n="a" place="margin">Io de Comb. Cōp. l. <hi>6.</hi> c. <hi>29</hi>
                        </note> they teach, that <hi>Satisfaction in pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nishment must be agreeable to the fault, in weight, in number, in measure.</hi> And <hi>Bellarmine</hi> saith,<note n="b" place="margin">Bell. de Indulg. l. <hi>1.</hi> c. <hi>12.</hi>
                        </note> It is the Position of all their Diuines, that an Indulgence is not firme and certaine for the taking away of punishment, either in this world, or the world to come before God, except it bee giuen vpon a iust cause.

                     <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> teacheth, that<note n="c" place="margin">1. Cor. 1.</note> Christ onely was cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified for vs. <hi>Iohn</hi> saith,<note n="d" place="margin">1. Ioh. 1.</note>
                        <hi>The bloud of Iesus Christ cleanseth vs from all sinne.</hi> And in the seuenth of the <hi>Reuelation;</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">Apoc. 7.14.</note> all the Saints wash &amp; make white their long Robes in the bloud of the Lambe. Neither let <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thinke to elude these so plaine, so euident, so perspicuous places, with an idle distincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>That Christ satisfyeth only for the fault;</hi> seeing <hi>Paul</hi> vnto the <hi>Hebrews</hi> witnesseth, that<note n="f" place="margin">Heb. 10.14.</note>
                        <hi>Christ by one oblation hath consecra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for euer them that are sanctified:</hi> And that in such sort, <hi>As their sinnes and iniquities God will no more remember,</hi> that is, hee will no more punish. And the whole drift of the seuenth to the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> is, to shew, that<note n="g" place="margin">Heb. 7.11.18, 19.27.</note> perfection was not by the Priesthood of the Law, but by the Priesthood of CHRIST. Now therefore, if Christs offering and suffering made vs per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, it hath deliuered vs as well from the punishment, as from the fault.</p>
                     <p>Our Sauiour Christ himselfe doth witnesse, that<note n="h" place="margin">Math. 26.28.</note>
                        <hi>his bloud is shed for the remission of sinnes.</hi> And <hi>Iohn</hi> saith;<note n="i" place="margin">1. Ioh. 2.2.</note>
                        <hi>He is the reconciliation for our sinnes;</hi> but without satisfaction there can be no reconciliation. Therefore, if Christ hath reconciled vs to God, he hath also giuen for vs satisfaction to God.</p>
                     <p>And thus much of the Indulgences of the Man of <hi>Rome,</hi> who through couetousnes and feined words<note n="k" place="margin">2. Pet. 2.</note> maketh merchandize of the bodies and soules of men, promising li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty vnto others, and is himselfe the seruant of corruption. Good Lord purge thy Church from this deceitfulnesse of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan, and make vs know and feele, that the Key of power is in God, the Key of satisfaction is in Christ, the Key of mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nistration is in the Pastors of the church by true preaching of the holy word.<note place="margin">Simile Gēma p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                        <hi>CHAP. XXVI.</hi> Of the yoake of Traditions imposed by the Church of Rome, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the authoritie of Christ.</head>
                     <p>I Haue heretofore spoken of Traditions wronging the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheticall office of Iesus Christ, whilst they are made equall to the doctrine of him our supreame Prophet. Now I must shew, how they are opposite also to his soueraigne King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dignitie. For to impose taxes, and burdens, and lawes, vpon the subiects of any Prince without his licence and without commission: and to require the same obedience to such vsurpations, as vnto the true and established lawes of the Kingdome, must needs be traiterous presumption.</p>
                     <p>Many times the Scripture it selfe, and the doctrine of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments therein contained, is called a Tradition. So, <hi>Basill</hi> saith,<note n="a" place="margin">Baptismus verò noster est iuxta ipsā domini traditionem. Basil. Cont. Apol. erro. l. <hi>3.</hi> post med ū. verbo qui verò hoc.</note> Our Baptisme is according to the Lords own Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. And <hi>Cyprian</hi> saith, that if we doubt in any thing, we must haue recourse vnto the Dominicall and Euangelicall spring, and vnto the Apostolicall Tradition; which by the words following we may perceiue he vnderstood to bee the Canonicall Scripture.</p>
                     <p>The testimonie also of the Church touching the receiuing and faithfull preseruation of Scriptures from time to time, is a necessary Tradition. Yet thereby wee make not the Church of greater authoritie then the Scripture. But, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though in the Scripture there is dignitie and power inough to witnesse it to bee the word of God: Yet wee allow the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonie of the church from age to age, as a notable witnes in this behalfe.</p>
                     <p>Traditions also may these points of doctrine bee called, which, although <hi>verbatim,</hi> and in very words, they are not found in Scriptures: yet by necessitie of consequence they are vndoubtedly approued; as the word Trinitie, when wee speake of the three persons: the Baptisme of Infants: the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments: the Apostolicall Creed, and such like. These we
<pb n="658" facs="tcp:2645:381"/> also receiue as the very Tradition of the spirit of God deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red in the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>There is a fourth kinde of Tradition touching the gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the church. For as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap>e Apostles deliuered according to the state and occasion of euery particular church a forme of discipline: So afterwards other teachers that were the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments of God for the planting of churches throughout the world, gaue also seuerall formes of discipline which see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med most conuenient for the seuerall nations conuerted. But in all such rules and plotformes of gouernement it must bee diligently obserued, that they be not repugnant to the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell of IESVS CHRIST, and that they obscure not the benefits of the passion of Christ, either by their needless mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, or blinde superstition. It must also before all things be auoided, that these Traditions be not made equall to the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred word and Scriptures of God.</p>
                     <p>The fift kinde of Traditions are those, which beside and against the Scriptures the Romish church doth not onely maintaine, but contendeth to be Apostolicall, and to bee e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quall with the written Canon of the Sacred Scriptures. Of these Traditions wee must needs deeme, that vnto the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Regalitie of Christ they are plainely opposite, since hee himselfe hath so often complained of them, and reproued them in the Pharisies, his professed enemies.

                     <p>In the Scripture many times, the word <hi>Tradition</hi> is taken for deliuering of doctrine, and it is construed both in the good, and euill part.

                     <p>In all the whole Scripture the holy Spirit neuer sendeth vs vnto the Traditions of the Elders, which are beside the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the Word.

Much more then may we now iustly suspect, that the Traditions, which vnder the Apostles name are vsed in the Church, are not Apostolicall, nor truely fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered vpon them, seeing they are so much differing from the doctrine deliuered in the Euangelicall and Apostolicall writings.</p>

                     <p>Here now it is most necessarie to shew, that chastitie is not opposite vnto honest Marriage, but vnto forbidden, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dring, and vnlawfull lusts. And this by sundry Arguments is manifest.</p>
                     <p>My first Reason I take from the Institution it selfe, which was from God, and blessed by him, euen as concerning the coniugall copulation. For he saith;<note n="s" place="margin">Gen. 1.28.</note>
                        <hi>Be fruitfull and mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply.</hi> This Institution our Sauiour himselfe commendeth, say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;<note n="t" place="margin">Math. 19.3.4.</note>

For the pure, holy, immaculate Spirit of God is author thereof.</p>
                     <p>My second reason I take from the dignitie of the thing, whereof it is a mysterie.<note n="u" place="margin">Psal. 45. Salom. Song <hi>per totum.</hi>
                        </note> For Matrimonie is a signe, and a resemblance of the spirituall coniunction, and happy vnion betwixt Christ &amp; his Church; as in sundry places of Scripture it appeareth. A cleane state of life therefore it is, vnder which Iesus Christ would figure his sweet and vnseparable Marriage vnto his Church; yea, this his loue vnto his Church, and his vnity with her,<note n="w" place="margin">Ezech. 16.8. 1. Ioh. 3.9. 1. Pet. 1.3.</note> hee compareth many times to the very coniugall act it selfe. This then shall be our second Argument; God neuer likeneth his grace, nor typifieth his fauour vnder absolute sinne, which is no way cleane, no way holy: but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Matrimoniall contract and worke, God figureth his loue to the Church; therefore the Matrimoniall contract and worke are not altogether vncleane, nor simply euill.</p>
                     <pb n="667" facs="tcp:2645:385"/>
                     <p>The third proofe I take from the witnesse of the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; In which Marriage is accounted a chaste, cleane, and pure estate of life. The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> saith; <hi>(x) This is the will of God, euen your holinesse,</hi>
                        <note n="u" place="margin">1. Thess. 4.3.</note>
                        <hi>that yee should abstaine from fornication, that euery one of you should know how to possesse his vessell in holinesse and honour, not in the lust of concupiscence, as the Gentiles which know not God.</hi> By this it is manifest, that whosoeuer abstaineth from fornication, and Heathenish lusts, keepeth his vessell in honour and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linesse; wherefore in honest Matrimonie the vessell is holy and honourable.</p>
                     <p>The Apostle againe commandeth;<note n="y" place="margin">1. Cor. 7.3.5.</note>
                        <hi>Let the husband giue vnto the wife due beneuolence: likewise also the wife vnto the husband, and defraud not the one the other, except it bee with your consents for a time, that yee may giue your selues to fasting and prayer:</hi> But to that which is simply vncleane the Apostle would neuer haue exhorted; therefore the coniugall state is not vncleanenesse.</p>

                     <p>The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> commandeth <hi>Titus</hi>

In the 13. to the Hebrewes,<note n="b" place="margin">Heb. 13.4.</note> Marriage and the vndefiled bed are ioyned together, to shew, that purity and cleanenesse may be in lawfull Matrimonie. These, and diuers other places, with inuincible demonstration, teach vs, that in holy Matrimony there is pietie, chastitie, and cleanenesse pleasing God.</p>
                     <p>I must confesse, that as all the other states, offices, and actions of our life are corrupted, and by the frowardnesse of euill desires, and our sinfull will, stained (insomuch, that
<pb n="668" facs="tcp:2645:386"/> our very prayer, worship of God, receiuing of Sacraments, and such like, haue their corruption) so the honest and pure institution of Matrimony, and procreation of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is full of foule lusts, and abhominable filthinesse many times: But it is no new thing with God, to approue the vse, and pardon the abuse of things. If none but the cleane may minister vnto God. wee may well say with the Apostle, <hi>Who is fit for these things?</hi> For man hath sundry corruptions in all the course of his life, by which hee is polluted before God. And the same God, which in Iesus Christ forgiueth our other enormities, and looketh on them no more, wash<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth away also the Nuptiall faults, if we call vpon him, and offer vp our repenting prayer vpon the Altar of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, his onely sonne.</p>

                        </note> It cannot bee proued out of Scripture, that Priests should not be married.

                     <p>If the question bee proposed vnto <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> how this vowed chastitie is Apostolicall doctrine; he cannot saie, it is found in the canonicall Epistles. Why then it must needs be a Tradition: and of it we may truely say with <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                        <note n="d" place="margin">Scriptura negat, quod non notat. Tertul. lib. de Monogam.</note> The Scripture denieth what it doth not confirme. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion then is; if the vow of chastity bee a mere Tradition, it must be examined whether it bee agreable to the holy vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of God, or not. For it is euident, that when a Traditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is repugnant to the word, we ought rather to follow the written word, then the receiued custome. For the more or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly and better discussing of this point, let vs speake a word or two of vowes in generall, and then of the particular vow of Chastity.</p>
                     <p>Vowes in the olde Testament were of two sorts; Morall, and Ceremoniall. A Morall vow was, when a man either in contemplation of Gods mercy, or punishment towards him, or otherwise moued with any zeale, did vow to walke in the statutes of the Lord, to worship and serue the Lord God of Israell: this by the law euery man was bound to doe. But to binde themselues with the strictest obligation, to stir vp their owne zeale in themselues, and to make them the more ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest and diligent in performance of that with a good vvill, to which they were tied of necessitie, they vowed either the performance of the whole lawe generally, or of some one point especially. Heereof you haue sundry examples. Such was <hi>Iacobs</hi> vow;<note n="e" place="margin">Gen. 28.21</note>
                        <hi>The Lord shall bee my God.</hi> And, <hi>I haue
<pb n="670" facs="tcp:2645:387"/> sworne</hi> (saith <hi>Dauid</hi>)<note n="f" place="margin">Psal. 119.</note>
                        <hi>I am stedfastly purposed to keepe thy commandements.</hi> In the booke of <hi>Nehemiah,</hi>
                        <note n="g" place="margin">Neh. 9.38.</note> the people make a couenant to serue the Lord; and to binde themselues the more closely vnto the same, they write it, and seale it w<seg rend="sup">th</seg> the seales of the principall Fathers of Israell. In the last of <hi>Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dras</hi> also,<note n="h" place="margin">Ezra 10.19</note> The Leuites which had married strange wiues, gaue their hands to put them away; and this was a kinde of vow. Now all these morall vowes were made, the better to keepe the law of God; therefore in them it was principally required, that they should bee made according to the law.</p>
                     <p>The second kinde of vowes was ceremoniall; to fast, to confesse, to offer sacrifice, and such like. Whereof also the Psalmist speaketh;<note n="i" place="margin">Ps. 116.16.14</note>
                        <hi>I will pay my vowes vnto the Lord in the sight of all his people, in the courts of the Lords house, euen in the midst of thee, O Ierusalem.</hi> The ceremonial vows were but the Paedagogie and Schoole of the Law: they were significations of CHRIST to come:<note place="margin">Esay 1.15.16. &amp; 66.2.3.4.</note> they were contestations of faith: they were excitations to the performance of the morall law: without which all the ceremoniall vows were of no account with God.</p>
                     <p>Concerning these vowes many rules there were to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serued. First, they had certaine Canons in the lawe of the Lord, what they should offer, and what they should not offer. Hereof you may finde an absolute discourse in<note n="l" place="margin">Leuit. 27 per totum.</note> Leuiticus, concerning a mans owne person, his cattell, or his field. The first borne of the beasts might not be vowed to the Lord, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it was his by his owne ordinance:<note n="m" place="margin">Deut. 23.18</note> The hire of a whoore, the price of a dog, might not bee brought into the house of the Lord in any manner of vow; yea,<note n="n" place="margin">Mal. 1.14</note>
                        <hi>Cursed is hee</hi> (saith <hi>Malachy) that voweth a corrupt thing vnto the Lord. Ecclesiastes</hi> witnesseth, that<note n="o" place="margin">Eccles. 5.3</note> in foolish vowes the LORD hath no pleasure; and such were all vowes against, or beside the law of God. Wee see, that<note n="*" place="margin">2 Sam. 7</note>
                        <hi>Dauid,</hi> though out of a good minde, and a godly zeale, he vowed to build an house to the Lord, yet he was not permitted so to doe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we may obserue, that vowes were not necessa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily enioyned, but vncoacted; at euery mans choise and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection.
<pb n="671" facs="tcp:2645:387"/>
                        <hi>Moses</hi> saith;<note n="*" place="margin">Deut. 23.22</note> If thou leaue vowing, it shall bee no sin. Wherefore in Leuiticus,<note n="p" place="margin">Leuit. 7.16</note> a vow is called the offring of a mans owne free-will.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the vow when it was made, must of necessitie be performed one way or other.<note n="q" place="margin">Deu. 23.21.23 Num 30.3.</note>
                        <hi>When thou hast vowed a vow vnto the Lord, thou shalt not slacke to pay it: for the Lord thy God will surely require it of thee, and it shall be sin in thee:</hi> And againe, <hi>That which is gone out of thy lips, thou must keepe.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, if the vow were impossible, no man was bound to the performance thereof. Wherefore <hi>Abraham</hi> requiring his seruant by oath, to take a wife vnto his sonne <hi>Isaac</hi> out of his owne kinred, addeth yet,<note n="r" place="margin">Gen. 24.8.</note>
                        <hi>If the woman will not follow thee, then shalt thou be cleare from this my oath.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fiftly, if the vow were vnconuenient, and could not bee fitly performed,<note n="s" place="margin">Leuit. 27.8.</note> a man might redeeme his vow, and by a iust commutation or price buy out the same, according to the law: and if the man were poore that vowed, the Priest had power to dispense with him, according as he was able to get; but where the vow was lawful, honest, possible, by all meanes men were bound to performe the same.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, no vowes contrary to the law, or beside it, might be performed: what could not be done but with sinne, must not be done at all.<note place="margin">Iud. 11.</note> Therefore as the vow of <hi>Iepthah</hi> was rash in the making: so it was wicked in the performing, and not rehearsed in the Scripture as approued. Such also was<note n="t" place="margin">Iud. 17.3</note> the vow of the mother of <hi>Michah,</hi> who dedicated her siluer to the Lord, with a purpose of setting vp Idolatry.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, all this ceremoniall worshipping of God by vowes ordained in the lawe, is now altogether abrogate in the time of the Gospell: it is taken away by the death and passion of Iesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>Come we to vowes in the New Testament; and surely of them wee cannot speake much, seeing through the vvhole course thereof, there is neither commandement, nor pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise, nor example of them: neither can there be any additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to matters of faith beside Scripture in the Church of CHRIST, except vve vvill runne vvilfully into that repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hension
<pb n="672" facs="tcp:2645:388"/> of our Sauiour;<note n="u" place="margin">Math. 15.9. Ex Esay 29.</note>
                        <hi>In vaine doe they worship mee, tea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching for doctrines precepts of men.</hi> Yet notwithstanding, Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vowes in the New Testament may haue place, so they be not done in opinion of meriting, satisfaction and Iustifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, but onely by a strait bond to tye our selues vnto the performance of any part of our Christian duety, in humble obedience to the commandement of God; Neither doth this vow require any pompe, or solemnitie of ceremonies, in the professing thereof: Nor yet are wee bound to circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance of Time, Place, Person, or Quantitie, but so farre as we can, and to the vttermost of our power, to liue vnblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in our religion.</p>
                     <p>As a Morall vow in the New Testament is not cōmanded: So if it be by vs voluntarily vndertaken, aboue all things we must obserue, that it bee not against, nor repugnant to the word of God, but agreeable and conformable thereto.</p>
                     <p>Returne we now againe to the vow of Chastitie, which we haue formerly proued, neither to be found in the law, nor in the Gospell: And let vs see, whether it ought to be professed, in the Christian Church; The contrary whereof by diuers reasons is manifest.</p>
                     <p>First, it is besides the Law and the Gospell, as it is said al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready; Therefore the vow is vnlawfull, neither ought such a burdensome Tradition to be laid vpon the church beeing a free woman,<note place="margin">Gal. 4.</note> as was not imposed vpon the bond woman her selfe, I meane the Iewish Synagogue.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the vow of Chastity is not possible to euery one that taketh vpon him holy orders; Therefore it ought not to be imposed. The proposition is proued, first, by the testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of our Sauiour himselfe, who saith,<note n="w" place="margin">Mat. 19.11.</note>
                        <hi>All men can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not receiue this:</hi> Secondly, by the testimonie of the Apostle, who in the first to <hi>Timothy</hi> 5.<note n="x" place="margin">1. Tim. 5.11.</note>
                        <hi>commandeth to refuse the yonger Widdowes, for when they haue begunne to waxe wanton a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst Christ, they will marry:</hi> Lastly, it is proued by daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, that Priests and Monkes haue not the gift of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitie; no not the Pope himselfe; as without extreame im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudencie the Romish Church cannot deny.</p>
                     <pb n="673" facs="tcp:2645:388"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, the Papall vow of chastitie doth not obserue the Law of vowes set downe by <hi>Moses.</hi> It is not arbitrary, and of election, but of exaction and necessitie:<note place="margin">Leuit. 27.</note> it is not to bee bought out, or redeemed, as the vowes in the Iewish state were; Therefore it is vnlawfull, and ought not to bee enforced.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, it is a snare wherein the conscience of the vota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry is intangled, and they carried headlong into innumerable lusts of concupiscence, to beastly filthinesse, to vnnaturall abominations, in which they burne and defile themselues, as euery man may see.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, it is euident in the Gospell, that the Apostles them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues had wiues, and dwelt with them after their ministerie vndertaken; as <hi>Peter,</hi> and other Disciples. Wherefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postle <hi>Paul</hi> saith,<note n="y" place="margin">1. Cor. 9.5.</note>
                        <hi>Haue we not power to lead about a Sister a wife, as well as other Apostles, and as the brethren of our Lord, and Cephas?</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Sixtly, the Apostle alloweth, that<note n="z" place="margin">1. Tim. 3.2.12</note>
                        <hi>a Bishop and Deacon be the husband of one wife,</hi> such as gouerneth well his owne house and children; yea, he deliuers this doctrine in maner of a commandement; <hi>A Bishop must be blamelesse, the husband of one wife.</hi> For though it be indifferent to him that can con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, whether he marry or not, or if it be better not to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry at all, vnto those that are Eunuches themselues by nature: yet if a Bishop or Deacon cannot containe, it is necessarie that such a one marry. Therefore vnto the <hi>Hebrewes</hi> he saith,<note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 13.</note>
                        <hi>Marriage is honourable among all men, and the bed vndefiled.</hi> Surely, if it had beene dishonourable for Ministers to marry, the Apostle would not haue set forth the praise of marriage in such a Categoricall, or generall proposition.</p>
                     <p>Seuenthly, forbidding of marriage the Apostle sheweth,<note place="margin">1. Tim. 4.1, 2, 3.</note> to be the doctrine of them which depart from the faith, and of them which giue heed to the spirits of errour. The doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, I say, of Diuels, of false Hypocrites, and such as haue their conscience seared with a hote iron. Neither let the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manists say, the Apostle speaketh of the <hi>Marcionists,</hi> the <hi>Tati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> the <hi>Montanists,</hi> and the <hi>Manichees;</hi> and not of them: for
<pb n="674" facs="tcp:2645:389"/> the <hi>Montanists,</hi> and the <hi>Manichees</hi> did not forbid all to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry absolutely, but onely the perfect, or their chosen men; as the Papists doe now their religious persons, and their Priests. The Apostle speaking indifferently saith,<note n="b" place="margin">1. Tim. 4.</note>
                        <hi>To forbid marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age is the doctrine of Diuels.</hi> Wherefore he as well reproueth one Sect as other, of all them who restraine Christians from lawfull wedlocke.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, marriage. (they say▪) is a Sacrament, and doth con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre grace: but no men haue more neede of grace then the Ministers themselues, who are alwaies exercised about holy things; therefore to them of all men it should seeme marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age doth chiefely belong.</p>

Of these Christ saith;<note n="a" place="margin">Ioh. 16.23.</note>
                        <hi>Whatsoeuer ye shall aske the Father in my name, hae will giue it you:</hi> There are also speciall gifts, such as are not needfull to all the members of the Church; as the gift of healing, the gift of tongues, the gift of prophesie, the gift of the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation of tongues, the gift also of Virginitie. These hee hath not promised to giue vnto euery one that asketh, but the spirit of God<note n="b" place="margin">Rom. 12. 1. Cor. 12.</note> distributeth them according to his own good pleasure. The gifts without which a man cannot bee
<pb n="675" facs="tcp:2645:389"/> saued, God giueth to euery one that asketh by a liuely faith through Christ Iesus: But those gifts which tend onely to the glory of God, and haue particular vse in the Church, are not bestowed vpon euery one that seeketh for them.</p>
                     <p>The Priests in the old law might not keep company with <label type="milestone">
                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>2</label> their wiues, when they ministred before the Lord; There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Priests of the new Couenant may not haue wiues, who daily sacrifice vnto God.</p>
                     <p>This argument is a weake and friuolous cauillation.<note place="margin">Sol.</note> The Priests in the Law were bound to many Ceremonies, which pointed vnto Christ; amongst which this is one; For it foreshewed the virginitie of Christ in all the course of his life. But Christ being now come in the flesh, there is no vse of these Ceremonies, except wee shall still retaine the Iudai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call Priesthood: Neither yet doth it appeare out of 1. <hi>Chron.</hi> 24. Nor out of <hi>Luke</hi> the first. Much lesse out of <hi>Exodus</hi> 19. that Priests abstained from their wiues in the time of their ministration, as <hi>Bellarmine</hi> enforceth. Concerning the dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offering of the Popish Priests, it is a thing no lesse in que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stion then their vowed Chastitie. Neither let <hi>Bellarmine</hi> thinke to begge the question of vs. For wee deny that the Priests of the new Couenant doe sacrifice euery day: And wee say, hee offereth not at all any other oblation then e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery Christian doth, which is of prayer and thanksgiuing.</p>
                     <p>Abimelech <hi>the Priest demandeth of</hi> Dauid, <hi>whether the yong <label type="milestone">
                              <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>3</label> men haue kept themselues from women, that they might eate of the hallowed bread.</hi> But it is not to be thought, that <hi>Abimelech</hi> would so basely deeme of <hi>Dauid,</hi> and his followers, as that they were keepers of whoores. Therefore euen the carnall knowledge of a wife maketh vncleane.</p>
                     <p>I must answere as before; This argument presseth not.<note place="margin">Sol.</note> For we liue not vnder the Law,<note place="margin">Rom. 6.14.</note> as <hi>Dauid</hi> and his followers did, but vnder the Gospell: Againe, there were many pollu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the Law, which might make them vncleane by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mixture with women; as their naturall issue, Flux of bloud, Child-bed, and such like.<note place="margin">Leuit. 12.</note> These did contaminate in the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>saicall law, and not the lawfull coniugall vse. Lastly, though

                        <hi>Dauid</hi> himselfe were an holy man, yet he had his faults; and it was no blasphemie, to doubt whether hee, or his followers were not polluted with strange women.</p>

                           <seg type="milestoneunit">Ob. </seg>4</label> The Apostle saith, <hi>a Bishop must be irreprehensible, the hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band of one wife,</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Sol.</note>I maruell what came into <hi>Bellarmines</hi> heart to bring this place in defence of his votiue chastitie, then which nothing can be more opposite to his Axiom. For the Apostle in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinct and plaine words saith, a Bishop must be the husband of one wife, that is, of one wife at one time. Hence <hi>Bellar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine</hi> concludeth, he must haue no wife at all. But perhaps he standeth vpon the word Chaste.

                        </gap>, signifieth chaste, or sober, or sage. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> might hence well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude; The Apostle requireth a Bishop to bee the husband of one wife, and chaste; Therefore Chastitie and Matrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nie may dwell both together in one subiect.</p>

But be it that in single life wee may better serue God; yet wee must consider our owne strength, whether wee be able to liue vnmarried without the burning lusts of Concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence, which fight against the soule.

                     <p>In the nineteenth of <hi>Exodus Moses</hi> commandeth; <hi>Be you <label type="milestone">

                        <hi>and come not neere vnto your wiues;</hi> Therefore in the church the Priests ought not to haue wiues.</p>
                     <p>First, this is a Legall Ceremonie,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> it bindeth not vs in the Gospell: diuers things did pollute in the Law, which do not pollute in the Church of Christ. Secondly, this doth not proue, that Priests should abstaine, more then lay-men. For the commandement in the nineteenth of <hi>Exodus</hi> was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall vnto all, that they should not touch their wiues. Third<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, this commandement did not binde with a constant vow for euer, but for a time; Therefore it is nothing to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mish vowes.</p>
                     <p>In the twelfth of <hi>Exodus, The Israelites are enioined to gird <label type="milestone">

Therefore euery Priest ought to abstaine from Marriage.</p>
                     <p>No man doubteth but in wedlocke all persons must re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>straine their vnorderly lusts,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> vsing Marriage soberly and tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peratly, as it becommeth the children of grace; yet these ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies did not binde the Iewish Priests from Marriage, but taught them to haue wiues, as though they had them not, in all sobrietie: Much lesse can they binde the Ministers of

Therefore it is meet that it should to all the world be published and knowne, that the professours of the Gospell deny not godly humiliation and mortificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the flesh in fasting and abstinence; But they commend, and approue, and exhort all men with fasting to tame the body: to bridle the lusts of the flesh: to subdue the concu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piscence thereof: and to humble themselues before the Lord; yet so, that they superstitiously abuse not the same, nor vsurp it contrarie to the rules of Scripture, or constitute any false ends thereof, by which the crosse of IESVS CHRIST should be made of none effect, or the vertue of his passion obscured.

Cor. 6.6. 1. Cor. 7.5.</note> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> did not onely vse fasting often himselfe, but doth also commend it vnto others. <hi>Abenezra</hi> a learned Rabby saith; Wheresoeuer you finde the word affliction in Scripture, you must thereby vnderstand Fasting. Hauing shewed that fast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hath commendation both in the first, and second Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Let vs now inquire what fasting it is, which is in the holy volume approued.</p>
                     <p>Fasting is called of the Greekes, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, or, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, without foode: and of the Latines, <hi>inedia:</hi> but the Hebrews sometime call it, <hi>Zom, ab emulgendo, vel exugendo,</hi> of emptying, and suck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out; perhaps, because the inward parts are made void and empty: or (as some will haue it) of thirsting and dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse. They render it also by the word, <hi>Anah,</hi> which signify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth affliction; as in <hi>Deuteronomy, Moses</hi> witnesseth;<note n="o" place="margin">Deut. 8.3.</note>
                        <hi>He humbled thee, and suffered thee to hunger.</hi> And <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh<note n="p" place="margin">Esay 58.7.</note> of dealing bread vnto the hungry. Our Sauiour saith<note n="q" place="margin">Math. 15.32.</note> of the people who waited vpon him in the Mountaine, that hauing nothing to eate, he would not send them away fasting. Now this emptinesse, or not hauing foode, is in a generall tearme called Fasting: but thereof vvee doe not inquire.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Fasting is taken sometime for abstinence from sinne and committing iniquitie; as when the Prophet <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>say</hi> saith;<note n="r" place="margin">Esay 58 6, 7.</note>
                        <hi>Doth not this fast rather please mee; that thou loose the wicked bonds: that thou take off the ouer heauy burdens: that thou let the oppressed go free, &amp; breake all maner of yoake?</hi> And this is worthily called the great and perfect fast. Now this is not a
<pb n="681" facs="tcp:2645:392"/> proper, but a figuratiue vnderstanding of the word.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, according to the proper signification, fasting is vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary abstinence from meat and drinke; And this is exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cised two manner of waies.</p>
                     <p>First, when we vse our meates soberly and abstemiously, that our soules and bodies be not surcharged with drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes and gluttony. And this vertue is properly called sobrie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tie, frugalitie, or Temperance. And surely, a good consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence will abstaine from venerious meats, which prouoke lust and wantonness; such as many licentious Epicures procure to be made for themselues.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, we abstaine for a space altogether from foode. This is properly called fasting. For abstinence ought to bee continuall with vs: but fasting is onely Christian Physicke, for a time.</p>
                     <p>They vsed not in the holy fasts mentioned in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture any choise, or difference of meates. There is a law in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed that from vncleane things the Iewes should alwaies ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>staine. But what meates they should vse in their Fasts, the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine Canon doth not determine.</p>
                     <p>When in fasting they did sustaine themselues with any foode, it was of the coursest kinde;<note n="s" place="margin">Esay 30.10.</note> bread of trouble, and water of aduersitie, as <hi>Esay</hi> speaketh: or (as <hi>Dauid</hi>)<note n="t" place="margin">Psal. 42.3.</note>
                        <hi>My teares haue beene my meat day and night:</hi> And in another place;<note n="u" place="margin">Psal. 80.5.</note>
                        <hi>Thou feedest them with the bread of teares, and giuest them plentiousnesse of teares to drinke.</hi> Againe he saith;<note n="w" place="margin">Psal. 102.9.</note>
                        <hi>I haue ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ashes as it were bread, and mingled my drinke with weeping.</hi> Of this kinde of foode <hi>Achab</hi> spake, when hee ordained, that<note n="x" place="margin">1. Reg. 22.27.</note>
                        <hi>Michea</hi> the Prophet should be fed with the bread of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction, and the waters of trouble. Such a kinde of fast also is described vnto the Prophet <hi>Ezekiel</hi>
                        <note n="y" place="margin">Ezech. 4. <hi>per totum.</hi>
                        </note> in that his my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sticall vision, wherein the misery of the <hi>Israelites,</hi> and their hunger, and scarsitie of course bread is described. In all these examples there is no fast from flesh, and filling of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selues with delicate and luxurious fish; such as the Romane <hi>Apicij</hi> vsed for wantonness, &amp; to increase lust in themselues: Neither doth this fast cōsist of Preserues, Conserues, Suckets, Marmelads, Gellies, Confects, spiced and sugred Banquets;
<pb n="682" facs="tcp:2645:393"/> such as a sober man ought to eschew, especially when hee fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>steth.</p>
                     <p>The Ancients then in their fasts many times ate nothing at all during the time of their fast. Such was that of<note n="z" place="margin">Hest. 4.16.</note>
                        <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster;</hi> in which they abstained from all food, meat, &amp; drink, for three daies and nights: and thereto they adde an humble abstinence from all other pleasures also, either of fine ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or women, or musicke, or any thing that might breed delight.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Dauid</hi>
                        <note n="a" place="margin">2 Sam. 12.16.17.</note> when he fasted, lay all night vpon the earth, and did eat no meat.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Daniel</hi>
                        <note n="b" place="margin">Dan. 9.3</note> ioyned sacke-cloth and ashes to his fasting:<note n="c" place="margin">Dan. 10 3.</note> and of his fast of three weekes of daies he witnesseth; <hi>I ate no pleasant bread: as for flesh and wine, there came none within my mouth; no, I did not once anoint my selfe, till the whole three weeks of daies were fulfilled.</hi> So the ninth of <hi>Nehemiah</hi> sheweth,<note n="d" place="margin">Nehem. 9.1</note> that when the children of Israel fasted, they did weare sacke-cloth, and put ashes vpon them. Such was <hi>Ahabs</hi>
                        <note n="e" place="margin">1 Kin. 21.27.</note> fast; hee rent his clothes, hee put sacke-cloth about his flesh, and fasted, and lay in sacke-cloth, and went bare-footed. Thus (you see) the true fasting was abstinence from all pleasing meats: from all delights of the flesh: from all that was dele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctable to the sense.</p>
                     <p>Out of this which hath beene spoken, diuers Corollaries and conclusions doe arise. First, that the Christian Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates haue power and authority to ordaine and proclaime publique fasts, when there is iust occasion; it being alwaies seene vnto, that they be not repugnant to the word of God: and they may also ordaine politicall lawes, forbidding meats and drinks, according as the necessity of the common wealth requireth. But in taxing the difference of meats brought in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Church by Heretickes, we haue not any thing to doe with the lawes which are established by godly Kings &amp; Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, prohibiting their subiects from any kind of meats vpon ciuill respect;<note place="margin">Rom. 13.2.</note> which whoso disobeieth, resisteth the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God: neither is abstinence in such a case a thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, since to resist the power that is from God, and the
<pb n="683" facs="tcp:2645:393"/> lawfull ordinance thereof, is against religion, and against the law of God.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, the ends, and right vse of fasting doe appeare to be three fould.</p>
                     <p>The first vse is, that it should be a signe of our humiliation in any imminent danger or calamity.</p>
                     <p>The second end of fasting is, to bridle the lusts of the flesh, and to tame the concupiscence thereof.</p>
                     <p>The third vse or end of fasting is, to make our selues the fitter for praier and adoration of God. To which in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet <hi>Ieremy,</hi> it seemeth, fasting is an excellent preparation;<note place="margin">Ier. 36.6</note> for the Lord commands him to read the words of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy in the Temple vpon the fasting day. The first end, namely, the signe of humiliation, hath more frequent vse in publique, then in priuate fasts: but the other two ends ought to be obserued, both in priuate, and publique abstinence.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it appeareth, that in our fasts wee haue three cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances to obserue; the time, the quality of the meate, and the quantity. The time must bee, during such space as the actions are in hand, to which our fasting is referred; as till we haue ended our deuotions of praier, or thanksgiuing; or till we feele the flesh humbled and chastised.</p>
                     <p>The quality of the fast consisteth in this; that, when in our fast the body becomes weake, and must of necessity be sustei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with food, it be the bread of sorrow, not of wantonness: the coursest diet and the vilest, but without superstition.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, concerning the quantity, euen with the coursest meats we must not fill our selues vnto satiety, but onely take a little to sustaine nature, not to pamper it.</p>
                     <p>These things beeing thus handled, let vs consider, vvhat are those spots in our fasts, which corrupt and leauen a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in nature it selfe good and commendable; and surely, this we shall best finde out, if we seek what it is, that God blameth and reproueth in the vse and custome of fasting.</p>
                     <p>First, the Scriptures manifestly reproue them, who in their fast put difference betweene meats, accounting one cleane, another vncleane: one holy, another vnholy. Our Sauiour
<pb n="684" facs="tcp:2645:394"/> CHRIST of all kind of meats alike pronounceth;<note place="margin">Mat. 15.11</note>
                        <hi>(f) That which goeth into the mouth, defileth not a man.</hi> This was shewed vnto <hi>Peter</hi> by a vision from heauen, when of all manner of foure footed beasts, and creeping things, and foules of the aire, the voice from heauen witnessed;<note n="g" place="margin">Act. 10.15</note>
                        <hi>What God hath clen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, that call not thou common.</hi> The Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> saith;<note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 10.25</note>
                        <hi>What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soeuer is sould in the Market, that eat, asking no question for consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence sake:</hi> And to his <hi>Colossians;</hi>
                        <note n="i" place="margin">Col. 2.16.</note>
                        <hi>Let no man iudge you in meat or in drinke:</hi> Vnto <hi>Timothy</hi> he witnesseth;<note n="k" place="margin">1 Tim 4.4</note>
                        <hi>Euery creature of God is good, and nothing to bee refused, if it bee receiued vvith thanksgiuing:</hi>
                        <note n="l" place="margin">
                           <hi>Ibid. ver. 1.2.3</hi> Io Ferus postil. ser. in Dom. quadra.</note> And hee calleth it a doctrine of diuells, to command to abstaine from meat. Wherefore <hi>Io. Ferus</hi> ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth three kindes of wicked fasts; the Ethnicke or Heathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish; which abstaineth for the health, or pleasure of his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: the Hereticall; which abstaineth from one kind of meat as euill in nature, and not from another: the Hypocriticall; which fasteth for vaine glory;<note n="m" place="margin">Mat. 6.16.</note> disfiguring their faces, that it may appeare vnto men, how that they fast.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they are reproued in Scripture, which make the fasts of their owne constitutions workes of necessity, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose them as a law to be obserued, so as without them there is no saluation.<note place="margin">1 Sam. 14</note> Much like vnto the fast of <hi>Saul</hi> in the first booke of <hi>Samuel.</hi> The Iewes, who demanded, whether re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned frō exile, they should fast as they did when they were banished, the Lord reproueth, and saith;<note n="n" place="margin">Zech. 7.5.6.9.10.</note>
                        <hi>When yee fasted and mourned the fift and the seauenth Moneth, now this threescore and ten yeares, did ye fast vnto me: when ye did also eat and drinke, did yee not eat and drinke for your owne selues?</hi> And hee addeth; <hi>Execute true iudgement, shew mercy and louing kindenesse euerie man to his brother &amp;c.</hi> Vnto the disciples of <hi>Iohn,</hi> which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of CHRIST, Why doe wee and the Pharisees fast oft,<note place="margin">Mat. 9.14.15.</note> but thy disciples fast not? our Sauiour answereth; <hi>Can the children of the Bride-chamber mourne, as long as the Bride-groome is with them? but the daies will come, vvhen the Bride-groome shall bee taken from them, then shall they fast.</hi> Heerein our Sauiour plainely declareth, fasting ought not to bee im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed as a necessity, but vsed as a remedy, when iust occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is administred.</p>
                     <pb n="685" facs="tcp:2645:394"/>
                     <p>Thirdly, all those fasts are reproued in Scripture, which are done in opinion of merit, as though we were thereby sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, or iustified in the sight of God. The Iewes stood vpon the merit of their fast;<note n="o" place="margin">Esay. 58.3.</note>
                        <hi>Wherefore fast wee, and thou seest it not?</hi> And this trust in their fasts <hi>ex opere operato</hi> the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proueth by the Prophet<note n="p" place="margin">Zech. 7.</note>
                        <hi>Zechary</hi> in the place formerly al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged. The same our Sauiour also in the<note n="q" place="margin">Mat. 6.16.</note> sixt of <hi>Mathew</hi> reprehendeth: And the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> warneth his <hi>Colossians</hi> of Traditions;<note n="r" place="margin">Col. 2.20.21.</note>
                        <hi>Touch not, taste not, handle not; which all bee in corruption, in abusing, after the commandements and doctrines of men.</hi> Of this it is, that <hi>Ieremy</hi> speaketh;<note n="s" place="margin">Ier. 14.12.</note>
                        <hi>Though they fast, yet I will not heare their praiers.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, Hypocriticall fasts are reproued in Scripture; such as was that of <hi>Iesabel,</hi>
                        <note n="t" place="margin">1. Reg. 21.9.</note> proclaiming a fast to murther <hi>Naboth.</hi> Such were the fasts of Pharisees;<note n="u" place="margin">Esay 58.4.</note> this is the fast vnto strife and contention, a fast altogether displeasing to God.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, all the fasts which are without praier, without pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose of amendment of life, without good workes, are abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minable to God. The LORD therefore reproueth Israel;<note n="w" place="margin">Esay 58.4.</note>
                        <hi>When you fast, your lust remaineth still, for ye doe no lesse vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence to your detters. Thinke</hi>

To this I adde; Christ fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sted 40. dayes, to fulfill the types which vvent before him in <hi>Moses</hi> and <hi>Elias,</hi> and that he might declare himselfe by this miraculous fast, to be the Minister of the New Couenant, as <hi>Moses</hi> by his fasting vvas approued and declared to bee the Mediator of the Old: Christ fasted, that the manner of the Redemption might be after the manner of the transgression: Sinne began in eating, and the Reparation began in fasting: Christ in fasting shewed himselfe to bee the Sonne of God, who so miraculously, and aboue the limits and strength of nature fasted; But yet Christ ordained not, that his Disci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples should imitate him therein: Hee did it but once: Hee did not abstaine from some kind of meats, and eat of other. Wherefore the fast of Christ is no patronage for the Popish Lent. <hi>Chrysostome</hi> therefore saith,<note place="margin">Chrisost.

                     <p>FOr diuers and sundry causes in the time of the Law, the infinite wisedome of the eternall God thought it fit, to establish Sabaoths and Holy-daies amongst the people of Israel his owne inheritance.</p>
                     <p>The first cause was, to keep in memory the sundry bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites bestowed vpon them;<note n="a" place="margin">Exod. 20. Deut. 5.15. Leuit. 23.</note> as, of their deliuerie from the bondage of Egypt: The preseruing of the first borne of the house of Israel: the fruits of the earth receiued: the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation to God: and such like.</p>
                     <p>The second cause was, to admonish them of the inward holinesse which they ought to exercise, by abstaining from the workes of their owne wicked will, and lusts of vncleane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse;
<pb n="690" facs="tcp:2645:397"/> wherein the soule is no lesse wearied and burthened, then the bodie with all labours that can be imposed vpon it.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly,<note n="b" place="margin">Ezech. 20.12.</note> that they should know, that it was God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe that sanctifieth them.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, to adumbrate and foreshew vnto them the rest and quiet peace of conscience, which euery labouring and burthened soule findeth in Iesus Christ.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, after any great deliuerance, or other singular bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fites obtained of the Lord, wee finde also, that the godly Iewes themselues did many times ordaine Festiuall memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials. But the Legall ceremonies (as we haue often said) haue receiued an end, and are all now abolished by the comming of the body and substance of felicity, Iesus Christ the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. VVherefore let vs consider how and after what manner these Festiuities either stand, or are taken away.</p>
                     <p>As in<note n="c" place="margin">1 Chron. 23.31,</note> the old Testament, the people vpon Sabaoths and Festiuall daies did assemble to heare the Law and the Prophets read and expounded,<note n="d" place="margin">1. Chro. 25.1</note> and to serue the Lord with Hymnes and Thankes-giuing, and did spend the same in holy exercises, setting aside the care of worldly things, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept in cases of necessity: So in the Primitiue Church, Christ<note n="e" place="margin">Luk. 4.15.16.</note> obserued the Sabaoths and other Festiuities, to fulfill the Law, that no lot thereof should passe vnperformed. And after him,<note n="f" place="margin">Act. 13.14. &amp; 20.7.</note> the Disciples for the Morall end of Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,<note n="g" place="margin">Act. 16.</note> Preaching,<note n="h" place="margin">1. Cor. 11. &amp; cap. 14. 1. Tim. 2. Apoc. 1.10. Ioh. 20.19.</note> administring of Sacraments, and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lique Liturgie, did also assemble vpon Sabaoths and Festi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uall daies, especially the Lords day; which for the memory of the resurrection they did solemnize in steed of the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth. But all these holy-daies were obserued with freedome from Iewish seruitude: neither did they place Iustification, or Sanctification in them. And of this the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> warneth his <hi>Colossians,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Col. 2.16. Gal. 4.9.</note> that no man iudge them in part of an holy-day: And the Galathians also, that they be not againe intangled in the yoke of bondage. For holy-daies, as they are Ceremoniall, were neuer obserued in the Church of Christ.</p>
                     <p>With the like godly liberty, free from superstition, did the
<pb n="691" facs="tcp:2645:397"/> purer age also which succeeded the Apostles, obserue the Lords day, and other speciall Feasts, and did spend them, not in doing their owne wils: but in reading and preaching of the VVord, administration of Sacraments, Almes deeds, and other holy exercises.</p>

Nat.</note> the <hi>Theophany.</hi> And the truth is, in tract of time, superstition ioyning it selfe vnto true Religion, hath brought in an Haruest of solemnities, festiuall daies, commemorations, halfe double, and double Feasts, with their Vigils and Octaues; and at last, the Church of Rome hath poysoned the whole Institution with her leauen of su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition and Idolatry. I will briefly rehearse some exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples thereof.</p>
                     <p>First, they teach, that there is a certaine peculiar inherent holinesse in festiuall daies, more then other; as the Rhemists plainely auouch,<note n="t" place="margin">Rheman Apoc. <hi>1.</hi> Annot. <hi>6.</hi>
                        </note> That God reuealeth vnto his Prophets rather vpon holy-daies, when men are exercised in contemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and sacrifice, then on other prophane daies. So you may see, that euen in the very substance thereof, they esteeme some daies holy, some prophane.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, they think the holy day to be profitable <hi>Ex ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re operato,</hi> by the very celebrating thereof; therefore they pray,<note n="u" place="margin">Sancti pracurso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit Io. Baptista &amp; Mart. tui, quasu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus domine, vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randa festiuitat sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutaris auxilij nobis praestet effectū, &amp;c. orat Sancti Praecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soris in Ro. Miss.</note>
                        <hi>Let the venerable Festiuity of thy holy Praecursor Baptist and Martyr, yeeld vnto vs the effect of sauing help:</hi> And of the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiuity of the Virgin they pray;<note n="w" place="margin">Rom. Miss. in nat. virg.</note>
                        <hi>Let the votiue solemnity of her Natiuity giue vs increase of peace.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thirdly, they seek by keeping an holy-day to obtaine sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, which is the gift of God, through Iesus Christ. The prayer on S. <hi>Matthewes</hi> day is a perfect witnesse hereof; for therein they desire,<note n="x" place="margin">Ʋeneranda solē<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitas &amp; deuotionē nobis augeat, &amp; sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutem.

                     </p>
                     <p>Fourthly, by their Feasts also they thinke to obtaine eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nall life it selfe; for they pray,<note n="y" place="margin">Rom. Breu. in Hebd. <hi>3.</hi> aduent. o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rat. prasta quaesu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus omnipotens Deus, vt redempti.</note>
                        <hi>We beseech thee, O Lord, that the solemnity to come of our Redemption, may conferre vpon vs the helps of this present life, and the rewards of eternall blessednesse.</hi> Wherefore the Prose <hi>Sancti Baptistae</hi> pronounceth;<note n="z" place="margin">Apud Clycthou.</note>
                        <hi>Per
<pb n="693" facs="tcp:2645:398"/> hec Festa aeterna gaudia adipiscamur,</hi> Grant that wee may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine eternall ioyes by these Feasts.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, their Legends and Missals do testifie of much super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stition, which was vsed with Lights, Candles, Hearbes, Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and diuers other beggerly rudiments, vpon their daies of holinesse and Festiuitie.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, they haue sundry solemnities vpon darke and Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criphe authority, without any substantial ground. Such are the Feasts of the Conception, Presentation, and Assumption of the Virgin, of <hi>Christopher, Katherine, George,</hi> and others.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, whereas by the witnesse of <hi>Dionysius, Tertullian, Iustine,</hi> and the most ancient VVriters, it doth appeare, that the Assemblies in the Festiuities of the Primitiue Church, were for the praysing of God, for prayer and preaching of the VVord to the edifying of men, the Papists haue turned all this into the shuffling vp of an Idolatrous Masse in an vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowne tongue; wherein like Parats, Crowes, and Cranes, they chatter vnto the Auditorie for an houre, or thereabouts, the Mysteries of darkenesse, which none doth vnderstand, and all the day after is spent in lewd Bacchanalls, lasciuious, and wanton dalliance. These are the spots in their feasts: these the corruptions of their solemne daies: with this Lea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen haue they infected the godly vse of festiuall celebrities.</p>
                     <p>God of his mercy, for his deare Sons sake, giue them a true sense and vnderstanding of their superstition, that they may eschew these Ethnick impieties, and seeke vnto the Lord with right and holy worship, according to his Word. <hi>Amen.</hi>

I will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, humbly gleaning after his aboundant haruest, onely in a word or two point at the malice of the <hi>Behemoth</hi> of <hi>Rome</hi> against the lawfull rule of Kings &amp; Princes, the true &amp; imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate <hi>Ʋicegerents</hi> of the Lord of Lords.</p>
                     <p>Fiue things there are, which aboundantly declare the dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and soueraigntie of the Regall function. The antiquity, and the authoritie of the institutor; The titles and appellati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; The tribunall to which they are accountant; and the amplitude of their Commission.

Some made Tents: some inuented instruments: and others for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med Metalls. Therefore it must needs be, if Kings came in with propriety and distinction of possessions, the office of a King was euen from the beginning.

                        <hi>Moses</hi> reckoneth vp diuers Cities built, and ascribeth still the founding of them to some one principall man, who no doubt gouerned the rest; as vnto <hi>Assur</hi> the building of <hi>Nini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueh,</hi> and <hi>Rehoboth,</hi> and <hi>Calah,</hi> and <hi>Resen:</hi> and of the strong hunter, or tyrant <hi>Nymrod</hi> hee saith,<note n="m" place="margin">Gen, 10.10.</note>
                        <hi>The beginning of his Kingdome was Babel, and Erech, and Calneh, in the land of Sinar.</hi> All this while wee finde no mention of any Priest in the Scriptures, during the first two ages of the world, but euery man was Priest vnto God for himselfe, and offered their own sacrifices; as<note n="*" place="margin">Gen. 4. &amp; 8.</note>

                     <p>Of <hi>Abraham</hi> it euidently appeareth in Scripture,<note place="margin">Gen. 14.</note> that hee

But now <hi>Melchizedech</hi> King of <hi>Salom,</hi> Priest of the most high God, the type and figure of Iesus Christ,<note place="margin">Ibid. verse 18.</note> brought forth bread and wine vnto <hi>Abraham,</hi> and blessed him. This <hi>Melchizedech,</hi> I know, the idle Iewes dreame to be <hi>Sem,</hi> the sonne of <hi>Noah.</hi> But the Scripture of God teacheth no such thing; and the Iewish Traditions are inuentions and lies of their owne deuising, pits of vanitie, which will hold no water. <hi>Melchizedech</hi> was a Priest of spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall forme and consecration: a Priest and a King together; the singular type of Iesus Christ; whose birth▪ whose death, whose parentage, is not mentioned in Scripture. Therefore no man can shew, that in his function he had either prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessour, or successour. Surely the Scripture speaketh not of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Priest, who by solemne profession did exercise among the people of God that holy office, from the Creation of the world vntill the anointing of <hi>Aaron,</hi> but him onely. This, <hi>Genebrard,</hi> who striueth and wrestleth himselfe to proue a succession of Priesthood in the world from the beginning, yet granteth plainely, where he saith, that<note n="o" place="margin">Leui, Caaeth, et<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum proninquis speciem quand<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>I haue shewed by the antiquity, by the authoritie of the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutor, by the appellations, by the Tribunall, to which onely they are accountant, and by the amplitude of their power, that Kings and Princes be the immediate vicegerents of God, aboue all other powers, estates and offices: And that of all their subiects, Ecclesiasticall and Temporall, they ought truely and faithfully to be obeied and serued.</p>
                     <p>Let vs now proue, that they ought to be resisted by none, nor rebelled against. This appeareth plaine, in that the scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture forbiddeth all kinde of iniury and contempt, which may be offered to Kings, and commandeth all kind of obedience both inward and outward. First, as concerning the very thought, <hi>Ecclesiasticus</hi> saith;<note n="n" place="margin">Ecclus. 10.21</note>
                        <hi>He that is a ruler among brethe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, is holden in honor among them:</hi> And <hi>Salomon</hi> saith;<note n="o" place="margin">Eccles. 10.20</note>

                     </p>
                     <p>This is proued expresly out of the very words of the law. The first cōmandement of the second table saith; <hi>Honour thy Father and thy Mother.</hi> Now, though I dare not stretch this

                     <p>Secondly, wee are taught not to speake dishonourably of the King. <hi>Moses</hi> saith;<note n="s" place="margin">Exod. 22.28</note>

                        <hi>Bellarmine</hi> therefore to curry fauour with his great Master, moueth euery stone, wresteth, and straineth euery string to proue that the Pope is both an Ecclesiasticall and Politicall Prince together: which while he laboureth to shew, what plaine falshoods, what crafty sophistications, what vnneces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary reasons, what toyes, what vanities doth he heape toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther!</p>
                     <p>I write not this, as though I did deny that a Prelate of the Church may exercise temporall Magistracie, or that I thinke they should altogether bee excluded from gouerning in tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porall causes. Neither dare I go so farre as <hi>Bernard</hi> doth with <hi>Eugenius</hi> the Pope: Reade these things, and then challenge if thou dare, being a Bishop, Lordship; or being a Lord, the Bishopricke. But herein doth <hi>Bellarmine</hi> mistake the questi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, for that it is not controuerted, whether<note n="h" place="margin">Bellar. lib. <hi>5.</hi> de Rom. pont. cap. <hi>9.</hi>
                        </note> it be against the word of God, that one man should be a Prince Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>asticall and Temporall: But it is in question whether any man may bee an Ecclesiasticall Prince, that is, a Prince ouer the whole Church. Secondly, whether, if it be granted that there be an Ecclesiasticall Prince, this Prince haue a supreme power also in temporall causes, because he is the supreme Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clesiasticall Prince. Thirdly, it is controuerted whether the donations of the Secular power and Principalities of the Pope in <hi>Italy,</hi> were good and lawfull, or not: and of this last point we are now to speake.</p>
                     <p>Surely, if the Pope haue any Secular Principality, he must either haue it by the Lawe of God, or by the Lawes of men: But Kingdomes and Territories are neither giuen him by the Lawes of God, nor yet by the Lawes of men. Therefore the Popes Kingdome which he exerciseth ouer diuers parts of <hi>Italy,</hi> and else where, is meere tyrannie and wrongfull vsur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation.</p>
                     <p>That the Pope hath not Signiories, nor Principality gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen him by Scripture it is euident: For first Iesus Christ him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe had not where to rest his head; much lesse had he world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Principality, or Secular Signiorie. I conclude therefore,
<pb n="712" facs="tcp:2645:408"/> since the seruant cannot be greater then the Master, nor the Vicegerent then the Head, the Pope can haue no worldly, no terrestriall Kingdome from Christ, which Christ had not himselfe.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, Christ doth put from himselfe all Iudiciarie power in worldly tribunals, all Secular pompe and earthly Domination:<note n="i" place="margin">Luk. 12.1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

Surely <hi>Bellarmine</hi> himselfe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fesseth out of the Scriptures wee haue nothing giuen to the Pope, but the Keyes of the Kingdome of heauen,<note n="m" place="margin">Ex Scripturis nihil habemus nisi datos Pontisici clae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ues regni coelorū: de clauibus regni terra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum nulla mentis sit.

                        </note> of the Keyes of an earthly Kingdome there is no mention.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, it cannot be proued, that for the first 500. yeares of the Church, while it had any shew of the ancient forme, any sparke of the Primitiue puritie, the Bishop of Rome had Iurisdiction, Patrimonie, or Lordship Temporall: They laboured in the Word, they sought not after the smoakie ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles of vaine ambition, nor yet were couetous of worldly Principalitie.</p>
                     <p>Now it remaineth to be discussed, whether <hi>Iure humano,</hi> by mans Law, by any iust title deriued and taken from men, the Pope haue attained to the Patrimonie, Territories, and Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipality he challengeth.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Rom. 13.</note>First, it is questionlesse that euery King receiueth his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er from God, and is ordained of God to be the Vice-gerent and Lieutenant of the Highest, to rule the people of the Lord with iustice and equity, to be the Noursing-Fathers of his Church,<note place="margin">Psal. 78.72.</note> to feed his people. No King, nor Prince there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore may decline this duty, or put it ouer and assigne it to any other, except infirmity of bodie or minde make him vnable to gouerne. But those Princes which gaue their Dominions to the Pope, and endued the Papacie with their Principali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in <hi>Italy,</hi> by <hi>Bellarmines</hi> owne confession were godly

                        </note> therefore they could not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their charge, nor deliuer it ouer to any other, which themselues receiued from God, and were endued with wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy gifts to discharge.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, no King may put his Land vnder tribute, nor make his Nobilitie and people captiue seruants to a foraigne power. VVherefore when King <hi>Iohn</hi> had yeelded this Realme of <hi>England</hi> tributarie to the Pope, all the Nobilitie of <hi>France</hi> in the presence of their King, protested that they would main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine to the vttermost effusion of their bloud, that no Prince could giue ouer his subiects to a foraigne Gouernour: For a most vnreasonable thing it were, that men and people, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitie and Gentrie, Laitie and Clergie, should be bought and sold, like beasts in a Market.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, the donation which is pretended to be giuen to the Papall Chaire, from <hi>Constantine</hi> the first Christian Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, through which many great Territories, Dominions, Signiories and Principalites, are challenged by the Romish Prelate, is an impudent figment, a lying fable, a shamelesse falshood; as in due place shall be declared.</p>
                     <p>Fourthly, the Princes who did indeed giue these Patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and Principalities vnto the Pope which he now enioy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, had no right so to do, they were themselues vniust in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truders into other mens possessions, and what they gaue was not their owne. To make this point cleare: There is no Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manist so impudent that can deny but that the great Lands and Territories the Pope holdeth in <hi>Italy,</hi> were since the time of <hi>Constantine</hi> the Great, belonging to, and in the pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>session of the Emperour: For <hi>Placidia,</hi> the Mother of <hi>Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lentinian</hi> the third, gouerning the Empire in her sonnes mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noritie, made <hi>R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#keyers" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="714" facs="tcp:2645:409"/>
                     <p>The truth is, while the Emperours were busied in <hi>Greece,</hi> and employed in the warres of the East, the Romane State was inuaded by diuers enemies, as <hi>Aistulphus</hi> and <hi>Desiderius,</hi> Kings of <hi>Lombardie;</hi> whom when the <hi>Romanes</hi> could not suppresse, nor yet from the Emperour in <hi>Greece</hi> haue suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent helpe, they were compelled to obtaine aide of <hi>Pipinus</hi> and his son <hi>Carolus,</hi> then vsurpers of the Crowne in <hi>France,</hi> for <hi>Martellus</hi> the father of <hi>Pipinus,</hi> most treacherously depri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued <hi>Childerick</hi> his Master, the right King of <hi>France</hi> of his Dominion, by the meanes of <hi>Zacharie</hi> the Pope. Now <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinus</hi> hauing ouercome <hi>Aistulphus</hi> in <hi>Italy,</hi> gaue the Exarchy of <hi>Rauenna</hi> to the Romish Bishop <hi>Stephen,</hi> and withall, the Cities of <hi>Rauenna, Fauentia, Caesena, Forum liuij, Forum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puli, Bononia, Rhegium, Parma, Placentia,</hi> although the Empe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour did earnestly require to haue all these Cities and Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tories, violently taken, to be restored to the Emperiall obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence againe, according vnto iustice.</p>
                     <p>After this, <hi>Eudouicus Pius</hi> sonne vnto <hi>Charles</hi> the Great, in recompence of the friendship of <hi>Leo tertius</hi> the Pope, who had receiued his father <hi>Charles</hi> into <hi>Rome</hi> and honoured him with the title of Emperour, gaue vnto that Sea the Citie of <hi>Rome,</hi> with the Principality, Suburbes, Villages, Territories, by Land and by Sea, Coasts, Harboroughs, Cities, Castles, Townes in <hi>Tuscia</hi> thereto belonging: All which of right be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longed to the Empire, and not vnto <hi>Lodowick.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Thus you see, that neither from God nor men, this Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonie and Lordship of the Pope in <hi>Italy</hi> is iustly taken: nor he himselfe a King, but a Tyrant; no Prince duely and orderly inuested into his Dominions; but what he hath got<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten by falshood, he holds by force.</p>

                     <p>Amongst the rest of rebellious practices I may not omit, that, because subiects in many places and Countries by so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne oath, haue bound themselues to the faithfull seruice of
<pb n="719" facs="tcp:2645:411"/> their Princes, Three notable false shifts our Romanists haue found out to frustrate all fidelitie, and so to loose the collar of Kings, which is the true and faithfull obedience of sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iects. The first is, that the Pope may absolue men from their oathes, and make the bond void, which before God and men with the greatest protestation is vowed. The second, that a man may with mentall reseruation, and by equiuocation sweare one thing, and intend another thing; and so falsely lye vnto the holy Ghost, and deceiue both God and Man. The third, that the Pope is the head of the King, and hath the<note n="g" place="margin">Extran Io <hi>22.</hi> si fratrum in Gloss.</note> Empire ouer all Kings and Princes committed vnto him (as some say) both Infidell and Christian. Of these let vs speake in order.</p>
                     <p>Concerning the discharging of Subiects from their oathes; it is common with them, as you may see in their Canons; <hi>Alius item, Nos Sanctorum, Iuratos Milites,</hi> and sundry other.</p>
                     <p>Of this impiety is there any example in the Scripture? are these the keyes of the Church? Did Iesus Christ, did his A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles euer teach such doctrine?</p>

                        <hi>That swearing to his neighbour he disappointeth him not, though it were to his owne hinderance.</hi> If this duty of keeping an oath ought to be so religious towards euery priuate person: how much more towards the anointed of the LORD, and the ruler of the people?</p>
                     <p>Wee see how reuerently<note n="n" place="margin">Gen. 14.22. &amp; 21.31. Ios. 6.</note> the ancient holy men tooke oathes, and how religiously they were performed; as that of <hi>Abraham</hi> to <hi>Abimelech:</hi> his seruant vnto <hi>Abraham:</hi> The <hi>Israelites</hi> to the Harlot <hi>Rachab: Ioseph</hi> vnto his Father <hi>Iacob:</hi>

                        <note place="margin">Ios. 9.</note> Yea, the Lord God himselfe, to teach vs what reuerence, what religion an oath requireth, sweareth himselfe, and by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selfe. And yet the man of sinne boasteth, that he hath power to discharge subiects from their oath, their faith, their prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stations, and all religious bonds of truth.</p>
                     <p>The second way of destroying Kings and Princes, is their Mental reseruation, and equiuocation; the most abominable poison that euer Sathan shed into the Church. This taketh all truth, all sinceritie, all honesty, all vprightnes, from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst the children of men; a most barbarous Axiom, which the very <hi>Lapithes,</hi> and <hi>Centaures,</hi> the <hi>Cyclops,</hi> the sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uage <hi>Nomads,</hi> the <hi>Getes,</hi> Man-eating monstrous <hi>Cannibals,</hi> would I think be ashamed to admit; to deceiue in swearing: in swearing, to lye and to dissemble; yea, to make the seale of truth, the couering of all vntruth. What Atheisme so impi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous? What Heresie so dangerous? The<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 6.16.</note> oath should bee the end of all strife; This maketh it the forge, and the beginning of Contention: The oath is the Glasse, wherein one man should see the heart of another; But with their equiuocation it is clouded, and couered in darknes, that none can know anothers meaning.

                        <hi>Henricus Auceps</hi> the Emperour had taken vpon him a solemne oath neuer to weare the Crowne vpon his head againe; meaning thereby, that hee would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer more exercise the Emperiall power; The holy Father the Pope perswaded him not to giue ouer, but to take vpon him the gouernement againe.

                     <p>I answere;<note place="margin">Sol.</note> All the Friers in the world cannot draw from hence a good conclusion, that the Pope may depose Princes. Euill lawes must be changed, and euill gouernment reformed by the Kings themselues, by their Parliaments and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sels of state; There is no cause to send for the Pope vnto the businesse.</p>
                     <p>Hee obiecteth,<note place="margin">Ob.</note> that one Kingdome may compell another to depose their Prince, when they cannot otherwise defend themselues from his wrong doing.

                     <p>His fourth argument is;<note place="margin">Ob.</note> The people may not tolerate an Infidell King, or an Hereticke which draweth the people to his Heresie: But to the Pope it belongs to declare and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine who is an Hereticke, and whether a King draw men to Heresie; Therefore to the Pope it pertaines to iudge Kings, and to depose, or not depose.</p>

                        <hi>CHAP. XXXVI.</hi> Of the Person of Antichrist.</head>
                     <p>THat Antichrist the begotten of Satan, the opposite ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the Gospell of Christ, is a body politicke, a state, a Kingdome of false teachers, obscuring the benefits of the passion of CHRIST, detracting from his offices, corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting and peruerting his word and Sacraments, persecuting his true Church; if with a serious consideration, and diligent eie, we search and perpend the Scriptures of God, it will bee plainely deprehended.</p>
                     <p>First, the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> calleth it a Mystery of iniquitie:<note place="margin">2 Thes. 2.7 Mat. 24.15</note> and our Sauiour, abomination of desolation. Which forme of speech rather importeth a Kingdome, and a society of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uill persons, then one particular person.</p>
                     <p>Secondly, of this Mysterie of iniquity the Apostle <hi>Paul</hi> witnesseth,<note n="a" place="margin">2 Thes. 2.7.8</note> that it did worke in that time, wherein hee wrote his Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians,</hi> and that it should bee destroied by the brightnes of the appearing of the Lord: but no one singular person can so long endure; therefore Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ is not one indiuiduall, or naturall man.</p>
                     <p>Thirdly, <hi>Daniel</hi> describing the foure Monarchies, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth them to beasts: and by the little horne rising among the ten hornes Antichrist is prefigured; so that, as the other ten hornes were states and Kingdomes: so this was also a state and a Kingdome. Wherefore, speaking of his eies he saith; <hi>He had eyes like a man.</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 7.8.</note> Which speech plainely doth distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guish him from a man; for that which is like, is not the same. Neither doth the reply of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> ouerthrow this argument, who saith, that in diuers places <hi>Daniel</hi> by one beast doth vnderstand one particular King; as <hi>Alexander</hi> by the Goat, <hi>Darius</hi> by the Ramme. For in this place <hi>Daniel</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Dan. 8.</note> calleth the<note n="b" place="margin">Dan. 7.17</note> foure beasts foure Kings. By which hee ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth it euident, that vnder the name of a King hee doth vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand a state, or Monarchie.</p>
                     <p>The fourth proofe I take out of the words of the Apostle,
<pb n="736" facs="tcp:2645:420"/> in the second Epistle to the <hi>Thessalonians</hi> and the second chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who saith; <hi>He that now letteth, will let, till he be taken out of the way, and then shall that wicked one be reuealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall abolish with the brightnes of his comming.</hi> From hence I reason; that by him which letteth, and must be taken away, sundry interpreters, as <hi>Tertullian,</hi>
                        <note place="margin">Tertul. lib. de resur. carait. Hier. ad Algasiam. q. <hi>11.</hi>
                        </note>
                        <hi>Hierom, Chrysostome, Ambrose, Austen,</hi> and the <hi>Rhemists</hi> in their Marginall notes, vnderstand the Romane Empire. After the destruction whereof, immediately Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ must bee discouered, as the Apostles words import. Then I thus conclude: Antichrist appeareth after the dissolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Roman Empire, and endureth till he be abolished by the second coming of Christ: but this space of time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taineth many ages, and hundreths of yeares; Therefore Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ cannot be a singular person, but must needs be a state, and a politicall body, which for the space of so many ages is to continue. For if we take the shortest account, and reckon the Roman Empire to haue ceased but at that time, when <hi>Lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowick</hi> the Emperour, sonne of <hi>Charles</hi> the great, yielded vp <hi>Rome</hi> with all the Iurisdiction thereof and the Territories about it, vnto the Pope, it was about the yeare 817. almost 800 yeares since.</p>
                     <p>Fiftly, Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> acknowledgeth, that Antichrist is a body politique. For he saith,<note n="c" place="margin">1 Ioh. 4.1.3</note> There are many deceiuers ente<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red into the world, and euery spirit which confesseth not Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus Christ, that he is come in the flesh, is not of God, and the same is <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, the Antichrist. In these words, first hee speaketh of many, and at the last concludeth all of them in one person, <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>, this is Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ.</p>
                     <p>Sixtly, all Heretickes deny Iesus, when they teach falshods concerning him, and affirme him to be such as he is not. But aboue all other the <hi>Romish</hi> Church denies Iesus to be Christ; for they haue taken from him all the offices; of Priesthood, of Prophesie, of Kingly power, to which hee was anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted.</p>
                     <p>Seauenthly, <hi>Iohn</hi> saith;<note n="d" place="margin">1 Ioh. 4.3</note>
                        <hi>Euery spirit which confesseth not
<pb n="737" facs="tcp:2645:420"/> that Iesus Christ is come in the flesh, is not of God; but this is the spirit of Antichrist, of whom you haue heard that hee should come, and now already hee is in the world.</hi> I shall need no further, I trust, to seeke arguments in this question, since Saint <hi>Iohn,</hi> who among all the holy writers is onely found to vse the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry word, Antichrist, doth plainely witnes, that his spirit is in all them that deny Iesus Christ to bee comne in the flesh, and that he himselfe, whose coming they heard of and expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, was then in the world.</p>
                     <p>The fauourers of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church stand much vpon the Article ὁ, <hi>That Antichrist,</hi> or <hi>The Antichrist;</hi> as though thereby it were proued, that Antichrist should bee one natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall man. But alas! this is a miserable shift. For as this Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle is much vsed in the Greeke tongue: so it doth not alwaies determine a singularitie of number; as you may see in the fourth of Luke; Where the Greek readeth <gap reason="foreign">

In which though the Article ὁ bee vsed, yet it is no signe of singularity, nor of restriction to one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular person.</p>

                     <p>It is plaine enough,<note place="margin">Sol.</note> that Christ speaketh this of euery ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uersary, which without authority sparseth abroad impious and vngodly errours. All which false teachers and false Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, as <hi>Theudas, Iudas, Galilaeus, Barcocabas,</hi> were better en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained among the Iewes, then Christ himselfe.

                        <hi>Many false Prophets shall arise, and seduce many;</hi> Therefore Antichrist shall bee a politique body of He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retickes, seducing, deceiuing, and leading into errour. As for that which <hi>Bellarmine</hi> inferreth, how Antichrist shall bee receiued of the Iewes insteed of Messias, this place proues no such thing. The Iewes receiued many false teachers, whom
<pb n="738" facs="tcp:2645:421"/> yet they beleeue not to be the Messias.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Ob.</note>
                        <hi>Daniel</hi> (they say) calleth Antichrist a King, not a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome; Therefore Antichrist shall be a singular man, not a State or Kingdome.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Sol.</note>I answer, <hi>Daniel</hi> calleth the foure Monarchies Beasts; and describeth euery one, as one seuerall beast: yet the Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chies consisted of sundry Kings, and sundry Princes. And <hi>Daniel</hi> in his second chapter, speaking of the Romane Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, calleth it a Kingdome: yet presently he saith,<note n="g" place="margin">Dan. 2.44</note>
                        <hi>In the daies of these Kings shall the God of heauen set vp a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome.</hi> So that the Prophet sometime vnder the name of Kings, signifieth whole States and Kingdomes. As by the ten Hornes many Kingdomes are signified: So, vnder the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gure of one Ram,<note n="h" place="margin">Dan. 8.20.</note> all the Kings of the <hi>Medes</hi> and <hi>Persi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> are typified.</p>
                     <p>Thus much may suffice to be spoken of the <hi>Person of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ,</hi> to shew that it is no new opinion, that this mysterie of iniquity, and abomination of desolation, is a Kingdom, not a King: a Politicall, not a priuate person: not contained in one place, but a Citie dispersed throughout the whole world.</p>

                     <p>AS when <hi>Saul</hi>

Yea, the standing vp of the little horne after the fall of the ten Kings or hornes, agreeth rightly with the Papall domination, who after sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pression and destruction of all the Hornes, Kings and King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes belonging to the <hi>Romane</hi> State, doth now sit there as the sole Monarch, and Ruler of the world, according as his Canonist saith,<note n="e" place="margin">Papa totius mun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di obtiuet prine pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum.

                     <p>Let vs speak now of the beasts mentioned in the thirteenth of the <hi>Reuelation,</hi> whom <hi>Iohn</hi> so describeth to sit in the chaire of <hi>Rome,</hi> that more plainly he cannot speak, except he should name the place.</p>
                     <p>In the Image and similitude of the first beast hee painteth out the greatnesse and power of the Ethnicke <hi>Rome,</hi> hauing the likenesse of the Leopard, the feet of the Beare, the mouth of the Lyon, that is, all the power of the Three Beasts, or Kingdomes, mentioned in the seuenth of <hi>Daniel,</hi> swallowed vp by him, who was vnlike, and farre surpassed all the other Kingdomes. For the very Dragon or Diuell himselfe gaue
<pb n="740" facs="tcp:2645:422"/> his power vnto this Beast, that all the earth should worship him: Which cannot be verefied, at the time wherein <hi>Iohn</hi> did write, of any State but of the <hi>Romane</hi> Empire; for that one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly then swayed the rule of the world, hauing euery knowne Kingdome and Nation; yea, the Iewes themselues in sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iection.</p>
                     <p>For the further explaning of the matter, least any man should doubt who this Beast should be, he describeth him doubly;<note place="margin">Vid. Napier super Apoc.</note> by his Heads, and by his Hornes. His Hornes were ten, that is, many Kingdomes and Principalities to him sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iect. For the number of ten often in the Scripture signifieth a great multitude,<note place="margin">Palatinus, Coelius, Tarpeius, <hi>other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise</hi> Capitolinus, Aueutinus, Quiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nales, Ʋeminalti, Es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quilinus, <hi>are the 7.

His Heads seuen; for that the Citie it selfe was then seated on seuen Hils, as in the seuenteenth chapter, the Spirit maketh it most manifest, saying, the seuen Heads are seuen Hils, on which the woman sitteth. Secondly, the seuen Heads are seuen Kings, in respect of the seuen-fold manner of gouernment, which successiuely hath flourished in <hi>Rome;</hi> that is to say, <hi>Kings, Consuls, Dictators, Decemuirs, Tribunes, Emperours, Popes.</hi> Of these (saith the Spirit) fiue are fallen. For the first fiue kinds of rule were decayed: one is, that is, the Emperiall; and one is not yet come, that is, the Papall.</p>
                     <p>Returne we againe to the Beasts; for in the end, the first beast, the Ethnick <hi>Rome,</hi> receiueth a wound by the losse of her great power, though it liued still, that is, was not vtterly destroyed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <note place="margin">Apoc. 13.11.</note>After this, a second Beast is described by <hi>Iohn</hi> to come vp out of the earth, because all his Religion consisteth in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane and earthly Traditions; And this Beast hath the two Hornes of a Lambe, that is, both Secular and Spirituall power challenged from Christ. He doth also shew great won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; for the strongest pillar of the Popish gouernement is lying and false miracles, wrought by the power of the diuell, but receiued of them as though it were fire from Heauen. This second Beast, by meanes of these signes which he doth in the sight of the first Beast, that is, openly in the Cities and Countries subiect to the Romane Monarch, deceiueth them
<pb n="741" facs="tcp:2645:422"/> that dwell on the earth: for by his meanes a generall defecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from the truth hath beene seene euery where.</p>
                     <p>Now whereas the first Beast receiued a wound, and by the setting vp of an Emperiall seate in <hi>Constantinople,</hi> was in her power diuided and weakened, and left also to the oppression of her enemies; This second Beast causeth the Image of the wounded and miserable wretch to be made, who now one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly retained life in herselfe without her antique honour: And to this Image he giueth spirit, that is, he continueth the life, and reuiueth the power of <hi>Rome</hi> being almost dead, and without breath, and speechlesse.

But the Image of the first Beast gat life by the benefite of the second Beast againe, the <hi>Caesarian</hi> Maiesty being turned into the Papall Maiesty, an Image of their ancient soueraginety.

                     <p>To these testimonies I may iustly adioyne the figure of Antichrist set forth in the seuenteenth of the <hi>Reuelation;</hi> where in expresse words the holy Spirit vnfoldeth himselfe, and saith; <hi>The woman which thou sawest, is that great Citie which reigneth ouer the Kings of the earth:</hi> But no Citie at the time of the <hi>Reuelation</hi> made, vnto <hi>Iohn,</hi> nor yet since, reigned ouer the Kings of the earth, but onely <hi>Rome;</hi> therefore <hi>Rome</hi> onely is the seate of that woman <hi>Babylon,</hi> drunken with the bloud of the Saints.</p>
                     <p>That this place also is vnderstood of <hi>Rome, Tertullian</hi> is witnesse, who saith,<note n="k" place="margin">Babylon apud Io<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hannem nostrū vr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bis Roma figura est. lib. <hi>3.</hi> cont.

                        <hi>Babylon</hi> in our <hi>Iohn</hi> is a figure of the Citie of <hi>Rome;</hi> neither can the Romanists auoide vs, by saying that Ethnicke <hi>Rome</hi> is vnderstood by the woman <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon,</hi> and not Christian <hi>Rome.</hi> For, as <hi>Daniel</hi> speaketh of a little horne rising vp amongst the ten Hornes, by which he distinguisheth the two-fold gouernement of the fourth Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchie, vnder Heathen Princes, and vnder Antichrist; and as Saint <hi>Iohn</hi> in the thirteenth of the <hi>Reuelation</hi> maketh the same <hi>Rome</hi> to be two Beasts, in respect of the two-fold state vnder Emperours, and Popes: so in this seuenteenth chapter hee distinguisheth betwixt the Whore, and the Mother of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome: betwixt Heathenish <hi>Rome,</hi> when she was gouerned by Emperours, and <hi>Pseudochristian Rome,</hi> now that she is ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led by the Pope.</p>
                     <p>The same Citie then is called an VVhore, with whom the Kings of the earth committed fornication: and the woman

This is nothing else but a distinction betwixt <hi>Rome</hi> and <hi>Rome,</hi> vnder Heathen Princes, and vnder the Popish Soueraignety. Before, in the time of the Heathens she was a VVhore, and made Kings and Nations drunken, with whom she committed her fornica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: But now the drunken VVhore is on the backe of the Beast, neuer so drunken, neuer so proud, as in the time of the Papall Regiment. And if before time she were an Whore, now she is the very Mother of whoredome; but still the same Whore, the same Citie.</p>

And surely, the Romanists so restraine all power, all knowledge vnto the Pope, that in fine they make him onely the Church; For, to stand to the determination of the Church, to be in the Church, what is it but to stand to the Popes iudgement, and to obey the Pope?</p>
                     <p>Here they will say, that by this we make the Romish Church the true Church, when we affirme that Antichrist sit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teth in the Church; and this Church is one, namely, the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.

                     <p>It is obiected, that the Beast which commeth out of the bottomlesse pit, shall murther the two Witnesses in the streets of the great Citie, which spiritually is called <hi>Sodome</hi> and <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt;</hi> where also the Lord was crucified.

                     <p>The time of his comming also they will haue to be in the end of the world; that<note n="a" place="margin">Gen. 15.12.</note> as in the euening, at the going downe of the Sunne the horrour of sleep and fearefull dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesse fell vpon <hi>Abraham:</hi> So in the later age of the Church, the grieuous fury of Antichrist, and terrible tempest of his tyrannie, shall afflict the Sheepfold of Christ.</p>
                     <p>The truth is; As the reuealing and manifestation of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ God in wisedome reserued to the later ends of the world: So euer since the very infancie of the Church, Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ hath beene a working mysterie, and a <hi>(b)</hi> secret euill

                     <p>The chiefest purpose of Antichrist is, to ouerthrowe the Offices of Christ, to which by God the Father, with the holy Ghost hee hath beene anointed.

                     <p>None is free from errour, but Christ onely.

                     <p>To say the truth, many things are by the Antichristian Prelates thrust into the books of the Fathers, which they ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer writ, spake, nor thought; Superstitions, Idolatry, Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions; which if the Fathers vvere liuing, they vvould vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly disclaime, and deny to be theirs.

                     <p>That Antichrist shall bee destroyed, and the shamelesse Strumpet receiue the meed and due reward of her deserts, The Prophecies both in the old and new Testament doe so assuredly declare, that, as he speaketh in the Poet,
